`goad_Server_activate_with_repo_id'

What's wrong with it. Does it have anything to do with gnome-pilot or

Are you running Mandrake 6/7? Their gcc is buggy and breaks with a lot
of packages. Try switching to Red Hat's gcc. I'm running Mandrake 6.1
with the Red Hat 6.0 gcc.

Subject: [Evolution] filter happiness and sadness

The good news: the filter "to" rule is now a "to or cc" rule.

The bad news: I fixed a spelling mistake at the same time, thus
breaking existing filters and vfolders. If you have filters or
vfolders defined, you need to change all occurrences of "receipient"
to "recipient" to make them work again after you next "make install"
in evolution/filter.

Eg:

M-x replace-string [RET]
receipient [RET]
recipient [RET]

Have a nice day.

So I take it CVS snaps have the ability to actually respond/create mail?  I
ask because the 0.1 version I installed does not have that ability.

Hi !

There should be an entry in the contact list for the "preferred language": this
would enable an application which would access the contact list to retrieve an
email address to send automatically the email in the right language.
Explanation: I have in mind an application which should automatically send a
mail to some of your contacts, and being able to know which language to use is a
definite plus. So there should be a hook te retrieve this.

Yeah, eventually we'll want to have to-only and cc-only rules, but for
now, people are mostly using this for "put mail to this mailing list
in this folder", so we pretty much all wanted to-or-cc all the time.

0.1 does have the ability to send mail actually. Even 0.0 did. If you
can't send mail, then you probably have some sort of
compile/installation problem.

Subject: [Evolution] Looking good, but a mail question

OK, so I just spent a few hours downloading and compiling Evolution and
related utilities from CVS on a woody system, and it's looking pretty
slick compared to 0.0 (the last version I tried). However, I have a
question.

I chose to import my ~/mbox file, which was in and of itself pretty
stupid, since I know it's not all stable yet. However, what i didn't
realize was that, upon checking my mail, it would remove all mail from
~/mbox. OK, I'll just copy the mailbox Evolution creates back to ~/,
right? Well, the mbox file Evolution made looks normal, but neither mutt
nor mailx can load it. So I'm a bit stuck. Is there a way to make this a
standard mbox file again, short of forwarding myself all the mail? Also,
shouldn't be there a way to prevent the clearing behaviour in the first
place? Not that I don't mind using Evolution to read my old mail, but
I'm a bit wary of using a pre-alpha program for that.

Oh yes, and apologies if this message comes across odd-looking, it's my
first attempt at sending mail with Evo.

It is a standard mbox.  Some mailers are just particular about what
they think is standard (i.e. there is no standard?).

You just have to make the From lines (any line beggining
with exactly "From " in the mailbox) be something like

From user@host.domain Thu Jul  8 22:30:12 2000

Rather than the From - that evolution uses.

Yes, you point it at a copy of your mailbox, not the real one. :)

Evolution incorporates mail so it can index and filter and control
access to its mailboxes better.

Looks ok in elm!

Something like the following might help:

formail -i "From " -s formail <mbox >mbox.new

The -i "From " thing makes it remove the "From " line and
sending it through formail again makes it add in another one
based on other headers.

evolution, I get this message:

Unable to get folder file:///home/ujwal/evolution/local/Inbox: No store =

The evolution directory got created OK, and there is an mbox file under =

The same thing happens when I try to open the Outbox or Trash.

Also, when I choose "Mail Configuration" under Tools, the evolution-mail =
process crashes.

Can anybod help?

Thanks,

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution 0.2 "Saccharomyces" is released

Dear lifeforms,

Our tireless team of dancing primates has assembled version 0.2 of the
Evolution groupware suite (codename "Saccharomyces").

Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, and addressbook application.
This release incorporates many new features and bug fixes since the 
previous version.

* Availability:

  You can get the Evolution 0.2 tarball here:

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/evolution

  Evolution also requires a new version of GtkHTML (0.5), Bonobo
  (0.15), GNOME Print (0.20), OAF (0.5) and ORBit (0.5.2).  These
  packages are available from:

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources

* Changes in this version:

        Shell:
        
          * Folder selection dialog (Ettore).
        
          * Folder creation dialog (Ettore).
        
        Addressbook:
        
          * LDAP server configuration dialog (Chris Toshok).
          
          * Integration of LDAP servers in the shell's tree view
            (Chris Toshok).
          
          * ETable-based view (Chris Lahey).
          
          * Printing support for the ETable-based view (Chris Lahey).
          
          * Address selection dialog integrated with the message
            composer (Chris Lahey).
          
          * Many miscellaneous bugs fixed (everyone).
        
        
        Calendar:
        
          * Printing support (Michael, Federico).
          
          * Many, many behavior fixes and polishing to the
            day/week/month view widgets (Damon).
          
          * New glade-based event editor.  This is unfinished but
            usable (Seth, Federico).
          
          * Mouse wheel scrolling support (Anders).
          
          * We have an awesome new engine for computing recurring
            events (Damon).  This will be plugged in to the new
            iCalendar code.
          
          * Internal and public API fixes (Federico, Seth).
          
          * Shell-related changes (Ettore).
          
          * Data model for ETable; this is not used yet (Federico).
          
          * New iCalendar support; this is not used yet (Federico).
          
          * Pilot syncing updates; this is not used yet (Seth).
          
          * Many miscellaneous bugs fixed (everyone).
        
        Mailer:
        
          Major features:
        
          * Basic IMAP support (Jeff)
        
          * Threaded message view (Michael, Chris Toshok)
        
          * Filters now work (original work by Michael, bugfixes by
            Dan)
        
          Smaller features:
        
          * Implemented moving messages between folders (Dan)
        
          * Very basic printing support (Dan, but it was only like 5
            lines of code, because gnome-print kicks ass)
        
          * "Delete", "Forward", and "Refile" operations now work on
            multiple messages. (Chris Lahey, Peter Williams, Dan)
        
          * Toggle read/unread flag when the user clicks on the
            envelope icon (Chris Lahey, Dan).
        
          * The "New folder" menu item now works (Ettore, Dan).
        
          * The filter/vfolder druid now uses the new shell folder
            selection UI (Michael)
        
          * Added "Cc" to the set of filter/vfolderable headers and
            make the filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule work
            with to or cc.  (Dan)
        
          * New key bindings: "Delete" deletes the current message and
            jumps to the next undeleted message. "N" and "P" go to
            next/previous unread message. (Dan)
        
          * Keep asking for POP/IMAP password until the user gets it
            correct or hits Cancel, and remember the result until the
            user exits (or chooses "Forget Passwords"). (Dan, Jeff)
        
          * Kludge Camel to output ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, since
            neither GtkHTML nor ETable supports UTF-8 still. (Dan)
        
          * Use the gnome-vfs "sniff buffer" interface to try to
            identify the MIME type of attachments without useful type
            information (Dan)
        
          * Allow saving drafts in the composer (Ettore)
        
          * Added "Received date" header to the set of possible
            message list headers. (Dan)
        
          * Partial gladification of the config dialog (JP Rosevear)
        
          Bug fixes:
        
          * Message read/unread/deleted flags should now be saved
            reliably when you exit, and summary should not be rebuilt
            when a rebuild isn't needed. Expunging should work
            reliably (Dan, Ettore, Jeff).
        
          * Fix disappearing toolbar bug (Dan).
        
          * Fixed a bug that made downloading of very large messages
            over POP incredibly slow, and various other smaller POP
            bugs. (Dan)
        
          * Fixed bugs that made large attachments sometimes get
            dropped and small ones sometimes get truncated. (Dan)
        
          * Fixed filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule to
            correctly match "to" rather than "from". (Michael)
        
          * Fix some text/plain formatting bugs in the composer. (Dan,
            Ettore)
        
          * Turn off search mode when getting new mail (to avoid
            corrupting the display). Make "get mail" always put
            unfiltered mail into Inbox rather than the current
            folder. (Dan)
        
          * Fixed a bug that caused "Re:" to be prepended even to
            subjects that started with "Re:" when replying. Added a
            default subject to forwarded messages. (Dan)
        
          * Make the "Attach" dialog in the composer remember the last
            directory it was in. (Dan)
        
          * Code to parse invalid date formats since some mailers
            generate them... (Jeff)
        
          * Fixed various small SMTP bugs (Jeff, Chris Lahey)
        
          * Fixed some memory leaks (Peter, Jeff)
        
          * Make replies use the text/plain part of a
            multipart/alternative if the user configured plain text
            rather than HTML mail sending.  (Dan)
        
          * Various config dialog fixes (Jeff)
        
          * Partial filter/vfolder GUI facelift (Jacob)

Please note that this is still software in development and should not
be used for production work.  We appreciate testers and contributors;
you'll be in our hearts forever, but please remember that Evolution
will still be buggy, incomplete, and temperamental.

Thanks to the many people who have sent in suggestions and fixes.

(And of course, this announcement was sent with Evolution. :-))

Enjoy,

  The Evolution team

Subject: [Evolution] problem w/ gnome-vfs 0.2

    Hi all, I'm sorry if this is inappropriate for this group, but I
think I have everything working to compile evolution but gnome-vfs 0.2
I've tried both an ftp.gnome.org tarball and a cvs update and neither
will compile.  Here's the problem w/ the tarball:

 gcc -g -O2 -Wall -Wunused -Wall -Wno-uninitialized -Wchar-subscripts
-Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-prototypes -Wnested-externs

any ideas on what to do?  I'm using oaf-0.3 b/c oaf-0.4 won't compile
with my ORBit 0.5.1.   I'm excited to get this working, but I'm not
quite sure what's wrong.  Thanks in advance,

I think you need orbit 0.5.2, you need the latest oaf, definetly.

You need the latest OAF and the latest ORBit (from the stable 0.5.x 
branch) - I think the latest is 0.5.2

If you can not compile ORBit, then that is your problem (but you have 
provided no info on that compile error so we can not help).

Ali

gconf-client.o(.text+0xb97): undefined reference to `gconf_listeners_new'
gconf-client.o(.text+0xbc4): undefined reference to `gconf_listeners_add'

I fixed this by swapping the -lgconf and -lgconf-gtk, as they were in the
wrong order.

Subject: [Evolution] Building OAF

Hi all !
Just trying to compile the packages I need to get Evolution running,
and
I've been halted at oaf.
When running 'make' I eventually get this:

make[2]: Entering directory `/home/jedi/src/Evolution/oaf-0.4.0/oafd'
yacc -d -v ./ac-query-parse.y
make[2]: yacc: Command not found
make[2]: *** [stamp-parser] Error 127
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/jedi/src/Evolution/oaf-0.4.0/oafd'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/jedi/src/Evolution/oaf-0.4.0'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

Any ideas how I can get it to build ?

Cheers !

Paul,

Looks like you need to install yacc (in /usr/bin on my Redhat 6.1 box).
Don't know which package this is part of, since the Redhat installer
does all that for me.

$ rpm -qf /usr/bin/yacc
byacc-1.9-12

Although why it isn't using bison instead is beyond me (i suspect
it can use either, but dont quote me on that).

Hi there,

I have been trying in vane to compile both evolution 0.1 and now also
0.2

If anyone could offer some advice/suggestions I would greatly
appreciate it!!

e-shell.h:32: gconf/gconf-client.h: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [e-component-registry.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/kschar/gnome/evolution-0.2/shell'

make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/kschar/gnome/evolution-0.2/shell'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/kschar/gnome/evolution-0.2'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

I always seem to receive these type of errors and I don't now that much about compiling "YET" but if someone could help me figure this out I would be grateful! Thanks!
 
  Ken

P.S. If you need more info please let me know - I'll be glad to provide it!

Looks like you need the gconf package as well.

Ok, so I have ORBit-0.5.2, but oaf-0.4 won't build, here's my error with
this.  How do I turn this error back into an error and not a warning that
makes the compiler exit?  Thanks again

Subject: [Evolution] GConf install errors

Hi there,

Trying to get evolution to compile let me to find out that I needed to
install GConf.  Soooo - I configured & made GConf with no errors however
when I try to do a make install I receive the following error.

Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

	Thanks, that fixed everything, still wasn't trivial to get
	evolution running
	but I think it's working now (we'll see if this message gets
	through).  
	preview release 3 looks pretty neat, I'm excited for this
	project!

Subject: [Evolution] gconf install problems

Hello,

I am trying to install the gconf cvs packages and am running into the
following error when I execute the ./autogen.sh script.  I'm not sure if
I'm doing something wrong or not, any help would be appreciated.

I have installed all the packages off of the Evolution webpage except
for Evolution itself as gconf seems to be required to do so.

The output follows:

[root@loki gconf]# ./autogen.sh
I am going to run ./configure with no arguments - if you wish
to pass any to it, please specify them on the ./autogen.sh command line.

Subject: [Evolution] Indication of unread messages

The latest version of Evolution is excellent; well done!  It's very
close to the stage where I'd consider it as my default mail reader.

But one facility which I consider essential is some form of indication
of the number of unread mail items in a folder - or even just an
indication that there is unread mail in a folder. Is this planned?

Yup. It nearly made it into 0.2... it may be working in the CVS
versions within the next week. (We're all annoyed by the lack of that
feature too... with lots of filters, it turns into a game to find
where your mail ended up when when you fetch it :)

Subject: [Evolution] turning error warnings into ignored warnings?

Sometimes I can't compile something because all of the warnings are treated as
errors and it exits. I want the warnings to be treated as regular warnings and
not errors. This is what I usually get:

cc1: warnings being treated as errors

I know theres is a configure option for this, I just don't know what it is.

I've gotten this with gnome-vfs in the past but I can't remember how I solved
it.
Now I've actually gotten to the point where I want to compile Evolution or
Nautilus. But it treats all my warnings as errors.

Thanks,
Tony

If you configure gnome-vfs (or oaf) with "--disable-more-warnings", it
won't do that.

As far as I know, gnome-vfs and oaf are the only package Evolution
depends on that behaves that way.

You should make sure that the things it's complaining about aren't
caused by you trying to build them against the wrong versions of their
prerequisite libraries though.

Hello,

I had that problem earlier, when I recompiled everything and specified the
--prefix and --sysconfdir directives to ./configure, setting them
appropriatly the problem went away.  I was using ./configure --prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc

Most of the packages needed those flags set so evolution could find them

Hope this helps

Dan

 Download Gconf 0.5. It is a must even though not given on helix's site.

 And, yes it is ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/unstable/sources/GConf/

Ok, so I got some help from fejj on irg.gnome.org in #evolution and he suggested that I set ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/share/aclocal"

but then when running sh autogen.sh I got the errors in bonoboerrout (attached)

so he suggested i get oaf, whose readme says that you have to have the latest orbit. so I got the latest orbit and

trying the sh autogen.sh there, I got the errors in errout (attached).

I really want to help, but I can't get anything to compile. I have gcc 2.95.2 and I have the latest helix gnome stuff.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what's wrong?

I also picked up the src of gnome-libs and ompiled them, and that went fine. But it didn't help anything else...

thank you in advance!

This suggestion is a shot in the dark, but it's easy to try. :-)

My theory:

The various Gnome RPMs are installed under /usr , but the default when
you run configure (or autogen.sh, which runs configure for you) is to
put things under /usr/local .  So Bonobo, ORBit, etc., are going to wind
up installing under /usr/local and (I assume) looking for support files
there as well.

So, try running autogen.sh --prefix=/usr instead of just autogen.sh;
this should cause all the code you're compiling to install under /usr
and look for support files there.

Best of luck,

Nathan

Subject: [Evolution] Crash on startup with OAFD error

Hello,

I am trying to run Evolution 0.2 on a Linux Mandrake 7.1 system,
building RPMs of all the packages apart from GConf (no spec file). After
installing everything I tried running evolution, and this error message
came up:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b.
(Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

I set OAF_INFO_PATH to /usr/share/oaf; if OAF_INFO_PATH is not set the
only difference is that 'trying /usr/share/oaf/' appears before the
warning.

Any help appreciated,

Michel

Have a look at /tmp/orbit-XXXXX where XXXXX is your username. Deleting it
should work because it seems that once you have started the program with a
wrong OAF_INFO_PATH, it keeps the configuration there. 

In my case, deleting the full /tmp/orbit-ctalon, and setting the OAF_INFO_
PATH to /usr/share/oaf worked ok, although I had to start evolution a couple of
times again in order to have the menus working.

BTW, this is on a debian dist, but I don't thing there should be differences
there.

No thats not quite correct during the autoconf stage (it is when
compiling), aclocal looks for macros in the default place where
it was installed, which is /usr/share/aclocal, and that is the
problem it is having.

I think he's missing the libtool macros, which probably means
he's missing (or maybe out of date) libtool (or alternatively,
auto* can't find it), try searching for libtool.m4, that is
where that macro is defined.

Phooey.  I thought that might not pan out.   Thanks for correcting me.

Subject: [Evolution] RPMs ?

Hi all,

First of all, I'd like to thank HelixCode for the whole great work
that's being done around Gnome. It will definitly help Linux penetrate
the end/windows user public.

I also was wondering if s.o. had been kind enough to build rpms of
evolution 0.2 and needed librairies.

Thx.

I have some problem with compilation.

I have latest helixcode gnome
I fetch evolution packages from gnome.labs.redhat.com

Subject: [Evolution] compiling evolution

Hi,

when i try to compile evolution i get this error message:

main.o: In function `main':
/tmp/evolution-0.2/mail/main.c:79: undefined reference to `gconf_init'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [evolution-mail] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/tmp/evolution-0.2/mail'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/evolution-0.2'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

it's weird, 'cause as far as i know it can find the gconf.h where
gconf_init is initialized. 
any ideas?

Hanne

I have installed all the required packages and they all compiled without 
any trouble, i'm not very experienced with compiling but I would really 
like to get this working... I hate evolution 0.1 working but no luck 
with this release.
Any pointers would be appreciated

Thanks in advance

Kyle

 Download Gconf 0.5. It is a must even though not given on helix's site.

 And, yes it is ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/unstable/sources/GConf/

Subject: [Evolution] Can't send mail and buttons disappear.

I have Evolution 0.2 installed fine however when I try to reply or 
compose mail the main window goes blank and all the buttons in the 
button bar disappear.  Anyone have any ideas?  

I also had the old 
problem of looking at something in the address book or calendar 
(can't remember) and then not being able to open the Inbox again 
because "A view already exists".

The only thing I didn't compile was bonobo-0.15 because I already 
had that from the 0.1 try at Evolution.

Very nice work by the way.

You can also set the ACLOCAL_FLAGS variable to additional paths, ie:

ACLOCAL_FLAGS=-I /opt/gnome/share/aclocal

I do this in /etc/profile or you could do it in your local shell setup.

Hi 

great product, btw ;-)

Evolution v0.2 (d/l it from cvs 4 h ago)

My system: i586-pc-linux-gnu
latest helix rpms
bonobo 0.15
gnome-print 0.20
gnome-vfs 0.2
gtkhtml 0.5
libunicode 0.4
oaf 0.4.0

If you click on Tools -> Mail configuration -> Sources -> select an
existing pop3 account -> Edit, then mail source type is set to IMAPv4

If you then change to POP3, username and server fields are resetted,
this behaviour should be changed (in my opinion :-))

Perhaps you could also add an Option on the "New Message" window to
change from HTML mails to plain text mails.

If i enable vfolders and click on outbox/drafts/trash, i get a message:
Unable to get folder filer:///home/wingman/evolution/local/Drafts:
Folder '/mbox' does not exist. If i create e.g. file
/home/wingman/evolution/local/Drafts/mbox i get no error.

Next thing, perhaps you could change the behaviour of the "End" key in
new mails. If i press it, the cursor jumps down to the end of the mail
and not to the end of the line. 

I also got some segfaults, if i close evolution, but i couldnt
reproduce it. (Shouldnt there be any core files in my home?)

Ok, thats all for now :-)

Yes, the defaults go missing when you go back to the configuration - the
information should still be saved and work though.  This will be fixed
shortly.

I had a similar problem. I think that the spec file for generating RPM is the
cause of this problem because no oainfo files where copied into /usr/share/oaf
for me.

So i made a manual copy of
./mail/evolution-mail.oafinfo
./addressbook/gui/component/addressbook.oafinfo

Subject: [Evolution] Problems compiling Evolution-0.2

Hi there,

I "thought" I had now met all the reqs to compile evolution properly but
I'm still having a problem.

This is the latest error - any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

Thanks!
  Ken

Get gconf-0.5 from ftp.gnome.org and install.  That ought to take care of
it.

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, I've already done that but I'm
still receiving the errors :-(   The same errors.

I also noticed this when running ./configure --prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc

checking for gnome-config... (cached) /usr/bin/gnome-config
checking for xmlNewDoc in -lxml... (cached) yes
checking if Bonobo uses OAF... yes
checking for oaf-config... (cached) /usr/bin/oaf-config
checking for gconf-config... (cached) no
checking for GCONF - version >= 0.5.0... no
*** The gconf-config script installed by GCONF could not be found
*** If GCONF was installed in PREFIX, make sure PREFIX/bin is in
*** your path, or set the GCONF_CONFIG environment variable to the
*** full path to gconf-config.

However, I've tried adding this to the path with no success.

Any other suggestions/tips that your willing to offer would be gratefully
received :-)

Thanks!
  Ken

did you install gconf in /usr ??
maybe it's installed in /usr/local
install gconf with --prefix=/usr

Hi Ken,

This may be the culprit:
checking for gconf-config... (cached) no
                              ^^^^^^

The fact that gconf-config is not found appears to cached (in
config.cache), so, rm config.cache, and rerun ./configure.

config.cache is created by configure script when it runs, if it doesn't
exist.  Next time you run configure, it uses cached data.  So, remove it,
that will force it to re-create the config.cache file, and (hopefully),
find gconf-config.  Also, make sure that gconf-config is in the $PATH of
the shell that executes configure.

Good luck,

-Mark

Hello,

There are now Evolution 0.2 RPMS available for Red Hat Linux.


They can be installed via helix-update.  When presented with the
mirror list, choose the "Evolution Preview" mirror.

There are two updates available: one containing the packages needed to
run evolution, and one containing the development packages needed to
compile the evolution tarball.


Alternatively, you can manually download the packages from:
ftp://ftp.helixcode.com/helix/evolution/distributions/RedHat-6/

or rebuild the SRPMS from:
ftp://ftp.helixcode.com/helix/evolution/distributions/RedHat-6/SRPMS/


We will be updating these when there new releases of Evolution are
made.

As always, please keep in mind that Evolution is in development and
will lose your mail.

Thanks,
Jacob & Ettore

Hello!

  I  don't  know  better  email  address for  getting  help  about  my
problem running evolution (0.2).
  - I've read the README
  - I've got helix gnome (debian packages)
  - I've installed all the remaining packages (into /opt/evolution)
  - I copied /opt/evolution/lib/*.sh /usr/lib
  - I     set    GNOME_PATH     (to    /usr),     OAF_INFO_PATH    (to
  /opt/evolution/share/oaf)

  The  Problem:  evolution  compiles,  but  when I  want  to  run,  it
crashes.

Gdk-WARNING **: shmget failed!

evolution-shell-WARNING    **:    Could   not    activate    component
evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail.  (Maybe  you   need  to  set
OAF_INFO_PATH?)

It seems to be an oaf problem.

Could you help  me solving this problem or forwarding to  this mail to
the proper person or mailing list?

Regards,

dLux

I would suggest the 'shmget()' failed is a clue.  Does the
system have SysV IPC support in the kernel?  Not sure which
comnponent uses it, whether its orbit, or oaf, etc.

Well, I have done all of the suggestions I've read so far, but I still get the OAF error, as well as a camel-ERROR.  I have set the OAF_INFO_PATH to /usr/share/oaf, copied over all the files, and I even deleted the /tmp/orbit-xxxx files.  No luck!  Any help would be appreciated.

camel-ERROR **: Could not open camel provider directory: No such file or directory

Hey, would you consider putting up a Nautilus-test mirror one of these days?
It's really hard to compile and keep up with all the sources, being so many. 
And thanks a lot for the Evolution 0.2 one =)

One more question.. Whatcha know about GNOME 1.4 or a 2.0beta1 version?

Alas, it does not work for me. I deleted all the files in /tmp/orbit-michel that
contained 'oaf' or 'OAF' in their names, and killed any active oafd - did not work.
So I proceeded to repeat again, this time removing the entire /tmp/orbit-michel;
did not make any different. Still the same error message...

Does OAF need to be compiled with any specific flags?

Thanks,

Michel

 Did you compile it as all other packages with the same --prefix and 
--sysconfdir as the rest of your gnome packages?

 You can obtain those by doing:
 gnome-config --prefix
 gnome-config --sysconfdir

 Thanks a lot. I could compile it, but prefer rpms anytime. Easier to 
track dependencies and such. The usual hype in other words ;)

 Anyway, I agree with the other poster, adding Nautilus would be a great 
idea.

 Maybe I should forward this to nautilus-list? I'll do it.

I suspect this is a sign of a deeper problem, but you will probably find 
that when make gets to to 'mail' it fails to include ``-lgconf -gconf-gtk''
in the list of libs... 

I hacked around this by correcting the make file, but evol segv's for me
due to gnome-split-install-fuckage.  I'm not sure if you will have this 
problem as well, but you can find out by editing the mail/Makefile and 
added the libs.

Subject: [Evolution] Gnome Print CVS status.

Hello guys,

   We might have not communicated this previously, but people are
running into problems because they are using gnome-print from CVS
HEAD.

   Lauris and I will be working on cleaning up massively gnome-print
in the next few weeks: we expect major API changes to be done in this
time.  Binary and source incompatible changes are being made to the
code right now in the HEAD branch. 

   If you need gnome-print, the official position right now is "use
the released tarball" until further notice.

   We do not have an estimate yet on when those changes will start to
stabilize, but we will try to keep people informed as the new code
base matures.

Best wishes,
Miguel.

Looks like you either (a) didn't build gtkhtml with bonobo support, or
(b) didn't build gtkhtml with oaf support. Either one would imply that
either you built the packages "out of order" (see Evolution's README
for an order that should work), or you installed something into a
non-default prefix and then didn't set GNOME_PATH when configuring the
later bits.

That means that at run time the mailer can't find the shared libraries
in the directory that it thinks you installed into (and thus won't
run, thus causing the shell error you also quoted, which is suggesting
that maybe you have an oaf problem, but it's wrong). Did you do
something weird with changing prefixes between configure time and
install time?

Thinking about this, I realized that all of the other packages installed into /usr, and evolution installed into /usr/local.  So I did a 'make uninstall' and then reinstalled with 'make install PREFIX=/usr' .  I no longer receive the camel error, but I still get the OAF error:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

Any other ideas?  OAF seemed to compile and install correctly.

I have a really good suggestion which I am actually stealing from Owen 
Taylor and his 'pango' project :)

Create RPMs using a different name than the standard i.e. gnome-vfs-ev, 
bonobo-ev, etc.

Also make sure they do not install in /usr (perhaps they should install 
in a /evolution directory or something). That way this will not 'clobber' 
different installations just for trying to play with Evolution (for 
example, I am hacking on gnome-vfs, I don't want to install a gnome-vfs 
RPM that will screw up my hacking/testing).

People may also need to run different RPMs for different packages.

Anyway - the way pango does it is install 'gtk+-gtkss' into /opt/pango or 
something like that. That way it does not clobber the Gtk+ RPM and it 
does not install files where they will get in the way.

Regards,
Ali

Hey - Thanks. 

I really want to keep up with the play on Evolution, do a little
testing, mail scren shots to my Windows buddies etc.  I habe Evolution 0
and 0.1, and even went as far as downloading the source...  But I am
into the idea of rpm's at the moment having recently rebuilt my entire
system.

   GNOME_PRINT_0_20 is the latest tag.

All good and well, except that 0.20 has a serious bug affecting
people who distribute precompiled packages: fonts are searched
for at configure time, not install time.

I've been trying to get these packages as described, however, when I try to I

Is the server working?  Or do I have something misconfigured?  Thanks

Subject: [Evolution] No Tools Menu in Evolution 0.2

Hi there,

I just installed Evolution Preview 0.2 rpms and noticed that there is no
tools menu nor is there an actions menu (though I am not quite sure
wether the last is supposed to be there).

I already observed that when compiling evolution from source the last
few times, but always assumed its related to my screwed up system. The
start up log from evolution, which is attached below shows three
bonobo-criticals which - I think - might cause the problem.

Any help would be apriciated. Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Try to define a mail account, and then restart Evolution. The menus should be
now there.

That does not work at all. Did you do anything special (like deleting 
~/evolution)?

When we start doing Nautilus releases, we'll definitely be doing packages
(RPMs), and not just source tarballs. But we haven't done our first Nautilus
release yet.

 I know there is no nautilus release yet, but it would
be a good idea in my humble opinion to do preview
releases a la Helix Code's evolution.

 It's like evolution is really usable yet anyway, but
it might help you have some user feedback as to where
to head in terms of features and such.

 For evolution, I am "compiling" a list of things I
don't like and others I like.

 And anything would probably be better than current
gmc. Heck, I hate those $HOME/.gnome-desktop/.....
cache stuff that appears even when you open trashcan.
Stupid things like dragging a file to desktop to
create links is non existant, but instead you need to
fill in full path of the damned destination.

 Anyway, I'll stop whining about gmc, but promise to
be there for its official burial ceremony.

Binary RPMs rock. I tried downloading source tarballs and while with
worked for me for the 0.1 release, doing the same with the 0.2 release
hosed my system. Took a fair while manually deleting dodgy libraries and
stuff to get a working gnome again. At least with RPMs you can easily
uninstall!

BTW, Im running evolution 0.2 (using the binary RPMS) and noticed that
the calendar and addressbook icons don't do anything. Is this a bug, or
are these just not implemented yet? Seems to send and receive mail OK,
and filters work for me, but I get seemingly random crashes when doing
things like creating new folders, and entering email settings.

Yes.

However, you may need to edit ~/evolution/config by hand and append a
path to the imap: URL there, to tell the provider where your mail
folders are relative to the default directory it puts you in.

Hello, 

I just started using Evolution 0.2, and I was wondering if you will be
implementing the ablilty to run filters on mail that has already been
received, ie your inbox.  The reason I'm wondering is that I just got
all my mail from the server and realized I didn't implement any of the
filters yet so I had to sort the mail by hand.

Thanks

Subject: [Evolution] IMAP feedback in 0.2

Hey.

Just downloaded and installed Evolution 0.2.... this thing is AWESOME!

Anyway.  I pointed it at my IMAP server that I have been using for 2
years under Netscape Mail.

From a protocol standpoint it worked PERFECTLY.

The implementation just doesn't seem there yet.

- Evolution is currently using INBOX as the default folder.  Usually
this set to the DEFAULT folder.  So it isn't really ever shown.

- The full path is always displayed :(  So instead of a Tree/Folder view
it is flat and then the full hierarchy is displayed.  So the following:

INBOX.lists.evolution@helixcode_com 

should really be this way IMO  It should be

<SERVER_NAME>
  - lists
    - evolution@helixcode_com

:)

- Retrieving messages doesn't work :(.  If I select one of these folders
nothing happens.  It can't be used in its current format like this :(

Anyway... keep up the good work :)

Kevin

Hi Dan,

That's what a 'VFolder' or virtual folder is.  If you go to
'Tools->Virtual Folder Druid', it will
allow you to create a virtual folder.  The way that works is, you can
set up your filter criteria, 
and give it a name.  It will appear in the Vfolders branch of the
Folders tree.  (If you don't
see the Folders tree, click 'View->Show Folder Bar' checkbox.)  Then,
when you click on the
VFolder by name, it will automatically apply that filter to your
Inbox.  I think that's what you
want to do, yes?

Have a good one,

-Mark

--I agree. Excellent work!  I'm using IMAPv4 so not sure if these errors also
occur under POP3 or not. I've tried 4 or 5 times search 'Body or Subject
Contains' and it's bombed each time.  

--First time I used it it didn't exihbit the following behavior but now it does.
Clicking Delete will not draw a cross line until I move to another message.
However, if I hit the Delete Key it works fine draws a line through the message.

Still can't figure out when hitting Delete Key where exactly does it skip to
next? Based on from, subject, time, thread...I can't figure it out for the life
of me.  It'll go to messages I've marked deleted, or new ones, etc. Help.

--Request:  I like how when scrolling down a message body that doesn't fit
within the screen it'll keep the focus & continue to highlight the message so
one can hit the UP/DOWN arrow or DELETE key.  How about having PageUp and
PageDown keys to move through the body of the messages rather than having to
resort to the mouse to scroll up & down through a long message.  Perhaps
CTRL-PageUp and CTRL-PageDown would scroll a 5 or 10 or whatever messages
through the list view. This would speed up reading significantly avoiding the
dreaded mouse.

Or if the PageUp/Down keys are going to be for something else how about using
the left & right arrow keys.

--Currently is the timeout 5 seconds for having the focus on a message before it
is marked read? 

--When attempting to expunge messages from IMAP account it shows an unknown

even attempting to?  Or is it yet to be implemented?

--When I was REPLYING it wouldn't wrap the text and far right side the end

take (since it didn't display it) and BCC'd myself and it actually did take the
input. Weird. I just tried this in COMPOSE and it did wrap text so go figure.

--Refile a message to Trash folder it says unable to create the folder even

Yes vfolders can be used to do something similar, but its not quite
the same.  And yes, we plan to implement this feature, like 'apply filters
to folder xxxx now'.

Ok, I set my ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/share/aclocal" and I moved the libtool.m4 there by hand after compiling and

installing libtool.

Now, when I try to compile ORBit, I get these errors: see attached orberr file...

And when trying to compile bonobo, I get these errors: see bonoerr file...

Basically, I'm getting a million duplicated macro errors.

I really want to get the project to compile so that I can try to contribute. But I'm not familiar with the workings of

autogen and configure scripts and macros... If someone can help me get over this initial step, I'd really appreciate it.

thanks again...

set ACLOCAL_FLAGS to include "-I $prefix/share/aclocal"
for the prefix where you installed the packages whose

Subject: [Evolution] several annoyances

Hi,
	Evolution looks good, but that's about as much as I can say.
I installed the rpms for my RH6 6.2 system and ran into a few problems:
I am using my local mbox to access mail.

1. Can you / will you be able to import mail from Pine in a simple manner?
(I just copied stored mail to mbox) 
2. The Tools and Actions menus (I think they are called, I have the
Swedish menus) have no contents.
3. Deleted mail is not deleted.

Cheers,
	Bo

Try without the -I /usr/share/aclocal, it should look there by default?

Otherwise, its because you ahve some duplciajted m4 files - remove the
older versions.  It'll only work if you only have 1 of each file
basically.

On my IMAP server, mailboxes are in ~user/Mail/
When I add the source, and restart Evolution, the Folder view gives:
- Mailserver
  - Mailbox1
  - Mailbox2
  ...
However, when I click on Mailbox1, it doesn't open, and on the stderr/stdout
screen I get: cannot open /Mailbox1.

If I change ~/evolution/config to read imap://server/Mail/, the Folder
view gives:
- Mailserver
  - INBOX
and nothing else.  Looks like it tries the wrong directory.

Subject: [Evolution] Trouble with rpms.

Hi all,

Please help - if you can :-)   I am running a RH 6.2 system with the
2.2.16 kernel.  I've downloaded the rpms using helix-gnome updater (the
updated ones that are out now 0.2-1) and when I try to start evolution. If
it's the first time it creates the folders then crashed. After that each
time I try to start it it just crashed with the following error output to
the term.

[kschar@scharknet kschar]$ evolution

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b. (Maybe
you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

ANY help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I'd really like to
see evolution running. It's got/will have all that I'm looking for
(e-mail, contact manager, etc.)

Thank-you very much!!
  Ken

Hi there,

I'm receiving the same OAF errors.


evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b. (Maybe

ANY suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution Preview 2

Using helix-update, I downloaded Evolution Preview 2 and installed it. 

However, any attempts to run it result in evolution simply
hanging. Eventually it fails to respond to the SaveYourself command and I
kill it off.

I'm using RH6.2. Any ideas?

Thanks.

We are going to have import facilities from the most common format by

I believe this is a Bonobo bug. I have similiar problems when the
selected locale is Italian. I am Cc:ing Michael Meeks the GnomeUIInfo
master so that maybe he can help.

Tools/Expunge would do it... :-/

As a workaround try to use the default locale.

This error will also come up if the mail component is run
successfully, but crashes before registering with OAF. We'd need to
see the whole debugging output to know for sure what happened.

This means you have something in ~/evolution which is not what
Evolution is expecting... did you unpack your source tree there?

If you rename ~/evolution to something different and start it up
again, it should work.

I'll check this out.

Space/Backspace do this in 0.2. I think PgUp/PgDown should be used for
scrolling the message list.

Yeah, something like that. I don't like that feature myself but we have
not come to an agreement as to how this should work yet. :-)

If you use a PRE paragraph, it does not get formatted (that's the way
HTML works). But actually, horizontal scrolling is currently broken in
GtkHTML, so that's why you don't see any text when typing.

I think that Refiling just does not work with IMAP yet. Jeff?

The IMAP provider doesn't support searching yet, and unfortunately, in
0.2, we forgot to disable it from the gui. So yes, it will crash if
you try. "Don't do that then." :)

Yup. There were some bugs with signals not being emitted which have
been fixed now in CVS.

It should always skip to the next undeleted message. If you've sorted
the message list by one of the columns though, it will appear to
behave randomly. It shouldn't ever go to messages marked deleted
though... Anyway, this code is being rototilled a bit, so hopefully it
will be fixed in 0.3.

Try Space/Backspace. :)

> message before it is marked read?

Heh. No, 1.5 seconds. It will be configurable later. (Maybe in 0.3)

The IMAP code is pretty new, and I think that was left disabled to
keep people from losing mail. (I'm not sure though.)

> --Refile a message to Trash folder it says unable to create the folder even

Oops. Yeah, the default folders are probably slightly broken. If you
create a new folder (File -> New Folder), you'll be able to refile
into that.

Does this happen if you switch to the default locale too?

It sounds like a Bonobo bug to me.

Subject: [Evolution] evolution packages for Debian

I have built some Debian packages for Evolution and its dependencies,
and am releasing them in the hopes that someone out there will find
them useful.

These aren't of nearly the same quality as the Helix GNOME debs. There
are some known minor packaging issues, but things appear to work
fine. Keep in mind that all the packages involved are in a prerelease
state.

In particular, the gconf deb runs a program in its postinstall script
that requires oaf. This starts oafd, which remains running after the
install is finished. Feel free to kill this root-owned oafd after the
install is over. I don't know a good way to handle this problem, since
root could be running some programs that require oafd to be
running. That rules out killing it off in the postinst. I'll look into
things to see what can be done.

These have been built and tested under Woody, though they should work
on Potato as well. As with the Helix GNOME debs, I consider any
failure to work on Potato to be a bug. Please file a bug report if you
see any problems of that sort. ( http://bugs.helixcode.com/ )

These have been built for the i386 architecture - that's the only
machine I have available at the moment. Source packages are provided,
though.

The appropriate apt line is:
deb http://spidermonkey.helixcode.com/evolution/distributions/Debian ./

Share and enjoy.

Peter

Hi Dan,

Is this the debugging output that you mean?  Thanks for your help. I'm
anxious to get evolution going - all I've seen so far is screen shots on
the web :-(

This has been fixed in the latest CVS, the reason it crashed was because
your IMAP provider probably didn't support SEARCHing, in this case
Evolution will now grey-out the search tool so you can't use it (eventually
we might code some sort of work-around so you can search on IMAP even if it
doesn't support SEARCH).

This has also been fixed in the latest CVS. I had forgotten to have IMAP
signal that a message/folder has changed so it was never updated in the
GUI. There was also one location in the mbox code that needed to have the
signals added, so I fixed that too.

I'm not sure :-)
I think this selection is based on how e-table widget handles it, and to
know for sure I'd have to ask Chris Lahey who isn't currently here.

I believe we have plans to attach key accelerators to as much as we
possibly can, and also have them configurable.

The current timeout is set to 1.5 seconds, we also plan to have this
configurable by 1.0

Expunge currently does send the EXPUNGE command to the IMAP server, but I
have commented out the code that marks messages as deleted, so expunge
won't actually do a whole lot :-)

The reason for this is because all text wrapped in the <PRE> html tag does
not get wrapped (all replied text is wrapped in <PRE>)

I have fixed this problem in CVS as well, the problem was that the current
state of the IMAP server wasn't correct.

No. Everything is fine when switching to the default locale. I dont
really know wether that is a bonobo bug, but since it throws all those
error messages it seems like it cannot get the german strings, right?

Thank you..

Subject: [Evolution] Pilot support?

(thanks again for Helix GNOME and Evolution. They're great! Especially the
Debian support.)

I just downloaded Peter's new Debian packages to my Debian box. Is the Palm
Pilot integration there enough yet for me to give it a whirl?

if so, could someone point me in the direction to get that going? I know how to
plug my cradle into the serial port but not sure what to do after that. :-)

fwiw, I currently use JPilot to sync my Pilot to my Red Hat box.

thanks in advance,
david

Looks like you haven't installed GConf, or, at the very least - it's not

I confirmed that my IMAP software I'm using does indeed support the SEARCH
command so it must still must be evolution isn't compliant quite yet.

>From the main programmer of our email software:
"SEARCH command is the part of the IMAP standard. <Email software> supports it,

I switched over to POP and SEARCH works great.

Can you unprotect us in 0.3?  Everyone knows to backup their email.  I just
created another IMAP account and copied my .mbox'es over to my new account to
test it out. So I'm prepared to crash and burn all email.

Refiling (with POP) doesn't immediately remove the message from the current
folder although I would envision it will in future versions I hope.

Under Local (POP3) why does it display Draft, Trash, Outbox, etc. they don't
exist or work?  Shouldn't it be able to create those on the fly?  Only by
creating new folder am I able to refile messages into those folders. Yep just
reread Dan Winship's message and he indicates they're still not quite there yet.

Virtual Folder Druid.  I thought this was working somewhat.I tried creating
From rule / added address someone@company.com but couldn't get it to show any
messages.  Does it only apply to new incoming messages perhaps?  I thought
vfolders are supposed to look in the INBOX (for now..other folders in the
future) and display only based on the rule criteria.

So I put edited the address from someone@company.com to "First Last"
<someone@company.com> and it bombed.  Isn't " " and < > a proper standard?

Subject: [Evolution] To-do list does not belong with the Calendar.

IMO.  I think evolution should take its To-do list code out of the
Calendar and add it as another 'module' (or whatever component, etc) to
the sidebar ('evolution shortcuts').

I believe this was just left over from the Gnome Calendar.  Since this
is in Evolution now it should just become a module on the sidebar :)

Yeah, I haven't coded SEARCH support for IMAP yet - as I first need a
daemon to test it with :-)

It's an optional command, as stated by the RFC (rfc2060)

Yeah, I probably will...I'm pretty confidant in the code anyways

You mean with mbox (when you use pop it downloads mail to mbox and that's
where searching/refiling are used) :-)
And you're right about it not removing the file from the original mbox,
because the way it works right now is to mark it as deleted (which doesn't
remove it from the mbox folder). I believe future versions will behave the
same, but if people don't like that idea I guess we could do it the other
way.

Probably because the "mbox" file doesn't exist in those folders, it'd
probably work if you went `touch ~/evolution/local/Draft/mbox`

Can you explain this a little clearer - I'm not sure what you mean

The evolution packages can be found on the second server listed in the
mirrors. I believe it's specially marked as the Evolution test server

I realized this a little bit before I received this email.  When I downloaded the sources, I put them in a directory called evolution.  So I figured maybe that was the problem.  After removing the directory, and restarting evolution, it worked great!!!  Thanks a lot!

No, Pilot integration is not working yet. Two people are currently

No, the To-do list is a nice thing to have together with the calendar,
mainly because you don't just want to have a list of things to do; you
also want to have dates to go with them. The DateBook+ for PalmOS does
display to-do lists together with the calendar view, and it's a very
cool feature that I use all the time.

Also, you can store your to-do information in the same iCalendar file
that the calendar is using.

Anyway, I think we are also going to have a separate to-do icon for the
to-do list in the shortcut bar.

When run from the command line this is all that prints. So I thought I'd
print out whatever extra info I could find :-) Sorry for the added "fluff"

If there is something else that's printing somewhere else that I don't

Thanks Dan for your help!

I think I'll stick with pine a while longer ;-)

Subject: [Evolution] Problesm with threads

Hi,

I've just installed the latest rpms under my installation of Mandrake 7.0.
It all looks great but I'm experiencing problems with threading the
subjects. I'm getting mail from a copy of my internal UNIX mailbox so 
it's all pretty standard.

If I enable threading in the middle of an evolution session, then there
appears to be no reason for the grouping of messages (cirtainly not on
subjectx - re:subjectx). I've tried sorting the inbox on sender, subject
and date - in both accending and decending orders but it has no effect.

However, if I leave threading on, exit evolution and start it up again,
then the threading is all OK. That is until I resort on any of the above
or 'get mail' again. The the treading goes out of the window.

I may me slow and this may already be noted but just in case.......

Steve

Subject: [Evolution] Re: [Helix Beta] Evolution 0.2 RPMs

Hi:

Just a couple of quick questions for a potential tester:

1.	Will Evolution allow leaving mail on a pop server yet so that I can
test it
	without loosing messages?

2.	I currently use Balsa for email - is there any way to import my old
mail into
	Evolution for testing purposes?

Thanks in advance for your answer, and for all your efforts.

Regards,

I just downloaded the preview 2 of evolution and it looks pretty good, but when
I try and check my mail with it I get the following error:

Unable to move mail:
Could not create lock file for /var/spool/mail/fjr: Permission denied

This is a user account.  I also tried this using root and it worked fine.
Has anyone else had this problem?  How do you get it to work for a user account.

No, POP still deletes mail off the server... :-(

You should just be able to copy balsa mailboxes into evolution as they use
the same format

The reason this failed as a normal user is because it doesn't have the
required permissions to create a file in /var/spool/mail/

We are aware of this problem and we will probably need to write an external
movemail program that can be set setuid (you wouldn't want evolution to be
setuid ;-)

A temp fix is to give your user access to create files there, but for a
multiuser system I wouldn't suggest it

Hi Dan,

Trying again for the command line to load Evolution this time it did give
me a bit more of a message but normally it's just the "Could not activate
component OAFIID" message. Here's the one I got this time - hopefully
this'll help :-)

Thank-you very much!

We may have to take you up on that offer :-)
I'll talk to Dan and Nat and see how they'd like to do it (my guess is that
we'll probably end up using the freeware one)

I kinda like this, I'll mention it to Dan Winship and see what he says

Okay, well there are 2 places where this can happen in the vfolder config
tool - 1 is "select messages with these characteristics" and one is "don't
show me any with these characteristics" so perhaps you are setting them
both? I dunno.  Also, filtering/vfolders are still under development...

That should work, but it may not be as tight of a rule...

Subject: [Evolution] Comments on Calendar/Contacts

Hi there, 

Just curious if birthdays entered in to the Contacts will be inserted
into the Calendar. I was thinking either graying out the field (having
the current date in there can be confusing) and having a checkbox to
enable the field. If enabled then inserting into the calendar would be
great for reminders. Also, does it make sense to store a year for the
birthday? Most people don't know the year that someone is born and it
seems more intuitive to have a separate field for the year which can be
left blank than to leave a non-valid year in there.

On the Caldendar view I like that the current month is displayed clearly
for the first three views, but it takes a little hunting around ont he
month view to see it in the first day's box. I can guess you're probably
trying to keep the gray bar above the calendar clean, but it'd be nice
if the month view could display the month a little more clearly.

Thanks for all the great work!

Ok, I played with this a little bit more and realized that the current
implementation is probably the best because you can have parts of
multiple months displayed simultaneously. Please ignore ;0)

Subject: [Evolution] Multiple sources

 I can't seem to be able to specify multiple sources
via the druid. It keeps replacing old server with new.


 Same goes for addresses. 

 I tried adding them to the "source" line in config,
but it didn't work.

 Is there a way to do this by hand?

 Btw, I am using the rpms.

Usually email clients only let you edit To, Cc, Bcc, and Subject.
But what if we could edit the Reply-To, right when your writing an email?
Of course the To tag would still be the same as your REAL email address but the
Reply-To would be an easier way of saying "you should take this up with so and
so at helixcode".

And as for the From-List tag, I've seen a thing similar in the mbox format for
a while now. And it would be nice if that showed up in your basic headings when
you simply view the message as normal. 

Does anyone like this idea?

Just an idea.

No thats bullshit, mail dir permissions of 1777 are perfectly safe
on multiuser systems.

But some systems are a bit anal about "security" and make it 
setgid mail, and some require setuid root permissions to set .locks.

Anyway, I said eons ago we should have an external movemail progra
but nobody listened.

Yes, but evolution matches against the email address part, after
its been decoded frorm the message.  The from thing should work,
but the druid's got issues so it might not even b e creating
the rule propely (its in the midst of a reqrite).

This is planned.  But there will also be a little task list next to
the day view in the calendar, just like it is right now.

We are going to have a more detailed view of the task list for the
full-blown shell component.  In addition, the little view next to the
calendar's day view will be enhanced to be prettier and more
functional.

Hey, this is a nice idea!  I just put in a bugzilla entry for it.  It

Subject: [Evolution] VFolder wishlist

I have been experimenting with evolution-mail's VFolders. I figured a
good test would be to see if it can emulate my netscape-mail folder
structure. My netscape mail folders are mostly of three types:

- messages from a particular mailing list
- discussions with particular people or groups of people
- emails related to ongoing projects (eg. work)

I was able to emulate the first nicely, the second sort of, and the
third not at all (my goal is to use VFolders, not actual folders).

The second could be achieved with a more powerful expression syntax (ie.
allowing "or" as well as "and", and allowing subexpressions), but a
shortcut option would be nice too (like the To-and-CC shortuct).

The third might be implemented by allowing users to assign arbitrary
attributes to emails (manual filing) and then filtering based on those
attributes. That might be tricky to implement but I think it would be
very useful.

While VFolders can't match my netscape mail folders exactly (unless you
can assign arbitrary attributes),  I understand there is a lot of
potential to provide features netscape can't provide (particularly,
overlapping views). In this area, I'd like to be able to filter based on
additional criteria:

- emails sent within a certain time period
- unread/new emails.
- unreplied emails.

In addition, for any VFolder I'd like to be able to easily switch to
showing only new (unread) messages for that VFolder, or alternately only
showing unreplied messages.

On the topic of unreplied messages, a custom email attribute might come
in useful here to be used instead of "replied". I would find it more
useful to record that an email has been "dealt with". For me, this means
either that I have replied to the email, or I have read it and decided
I'm not going to reply to it. Having this attribute means that I can
easily view all emails that I have not yet dealt with. I can imagine a
new column in the email list view with a toggle which I can click once
I've delt with a message. Replying to a message would automatically flag
the email as "dealt with".

There already is a GNU movemail program possibly it can be
used.  Netscape uses it.  I'm not sure about it's security but it should
be a good base to start from.

Subject: [Evolution] comments on todo list

Hi I've been playing with evolution, and noticed the following thing about
the todo list...

When I delete items, the item that becomes the current item appears to be
fairly random.  The behavior that I would prefer is that it went to either
the item directly above, or directly below, or chronologically above or
below..

In addition to deleting items, I would much prefer to complete the item
(which would be signified by say, a strike through of the item summary...)

It would also be nice to have the origination date and due date listed with
the summary (as well as a followup date, if it is added...)

A couple of nice features that I've found in other ToDo managers are the
following...

Have the Todo associated with a contact, company, and/or project.
Have it associatable with multiple companies/contacts/projects -
For instance, in the construction industry, projects are coordinated among
10s - 100s of sub contractors, contractors, architects, and engineers.  Thus
a piece of information often has to be tracked with many individuals and
companies.  Also, because many of the same companies and people are working
on many different projects, it is also valuable to track the project that
the task is associated with.

The way "Commence 2000" (a contact manager specifically targeted at the
construction industry) does this is by having three additional fields

To do for companies, projects, contacts

each of which has a widget that creates 'one to many' relationships

There are also four other fields that are somewhat useful

Todo for appointment
Related to task
To do Journal
Originated by

I think the 'to do journal' is somewhat redundant, since other views should
provide essentially the same information.

Other useful fields are the "Follow Up date", "Recurring", "Share", "Type",
"Duration", "Start date" and "date completed".

I'll try and find some time to do an interface mock up, to give you a better
idea of what they use for a layout..

PS - thanks for all of the excellent work that has gone into Evolution (and
the gnome libraries, and all of the other great GNU contributions)

will evolution be upgraded via the helix-updater?  i just installed the .2

Yes, as new releases of evolution are made, they will be made
available as updates.

btw, there is a reason why evolution doesn't use "." (~/.evolution)
like others apps ?

How will the way Evolution handles scripts/html/executables
be different than that of Outlook/Outlook Express?  Or will
Evolution users be just as exposed to the ravages of user
hostile mail as Windows users?

I'd say one of the best lines of defense that we have is that Evolution will
not be integrated into your system like Outlook/Express are in Windows.
This means that a hostile email can't corrupt stuff on your system, it
might crash Evolution but that'd be the worst it could do.

You *will* still have to be careful about running shell scripts/executables
that come as attachments though, however we will probably have Evolution
save them to disk with your default file permissions (which for the average
user is 644 - meaning the average user will NOT be able to just run these
programs; they'll have to chmod them first).

Obviously there will still be dangers. Even using a mailer like pine or elm
you have to be careful about running attachments.

Hopefully Miguel or someone will answer your question with a little more
detail than I have, but I hope my answer has answered at least most of your
questions.

If you mean Bonobo 0.15, gtkhtml 0.5, gnome-vfs 0.2, libunicode 0.4, OAF
0.4.  I installed these files.  My guess was that the OAF 0.4 has smething
to do with the error.  I am not sure what I did or didn't do that was wrong.

Did you download the supplemental files also? I had a problem similar

Evolution will be using iCalendar shortly (we use the older vCalendar
now), and it does support defining a hierarchy of related to-do
items.  This will be supported.

Thanks for your suggestions,

Do you plan to add category-support to the todo-list? I once hacked
this is gnomecal, and talked about it shortly during guadec (yes, this
is the category-dialog in gnomecal that still offers 'guadec' as a
todo-category ;-). I must admit you're Outlook-inspired dialog is much
nicer, though icons would be nice... However, would you be interested
to use this same dialog in the todo list? Or if someone sent you a patch?

(Some people say you have too much to if you need to add categories to
your todo-list, while others say you have too little to do if you have
the time to add categories.... however, i find them quite useful...)

2.  Whether or not it will handle newsgroups as well
as mail?

There is no document outlining what the final version of Evolution will look
like

Evolution *will* handle news, a lot of the code is already in CVS

The same reason pine uses 'mail', and elm uses 'Mail', no doubt.

Its not just for configuration data, but for user data like
mailbox files.

Subject: [Evolution] evolution install problem

Hey,
  In my helix-update list of mirrors I see one titled Evolution
Preview, located in Boston, type HTTP.  However, when I attempt
to connect to this mirror, I get an error stating that helix-update
was unable to download a list of updates.  I'm able to use the
other mirrors just fine.
  Because of this problem I decided to download the new evolution
snapshot by hand (and all the other packages necessary to install
it).  It all appears to work just fine -- I just felt someone
should know about this problem.

Regards,
  cyberclay

I'm glad it handles news. I was worried about that. Pan is too slow and doesn't
look right for me. Hope to see some interface for evolutions news soon. =)

I have a question...
Will you be able to use Evolution without the shell.
For example just open evolution-mail, evolution-calender or evolution-news with
it's own _seperate_ interface, or will we have to use the shell?

Tony

You'll have to run the shell. evolution-mail, evolution-calendar and
evolution-addressbook are bonobo components, they can't do much without
being embedded in something.

Subject: [Evolution] a few quick Qs

Four quick questions from an interested user:

1) will it be possible to have the threaded view non-expanded by
default.
(or have an option to make it non-expanded by default, if that makes
sense :-)

2) will evolution notice if mail is added to the mbox (eg. by procmail)
behind its back?
(atm, you have to restart evolution first)

3) will evolution be able to understand the 'Status: RO' lines in mbox
files (for imports, etc.)

and just to finish it off:
4) will the task list in the calendar have 'checkboxes' for when
something is done (but you don't want to delete it)?

thanks;

As usual, this being a 1.3.x release, I haven't even compiled this
kernel yet. So if it works, you should be doubly impressed.

Subject: [Evolution] Beginning work on evolution

Yay!!!! With the new release of evolution-0.2 I can finally compile and
run evolution! Thank you guys so much for your hard work. This project
is so exciting! 

Now that I have it compiled and running, I'd like to try to add a few
options I find convenient/important in other mail programs. I'd like to
try to work on the IMAP support. 

- There doesn't yet seem to be an option for "leave mail on server".
Hopefully this is the default, but I imaging there should be an option
in the mail config. 

- Also, mail within subfolders isn't being picked up. 

What about multiple mail servers? Is there someone working on this? I
dont know of another mail program that does this well, but I'd really
like to have one. 

So, where anyone have any pointers as to where I can learn about IMAP? I
have  experience programming c++ for linux/mac/win at deneba software (
http://www.deneba.com/linux ), but not specifically with mail programs.
I was the lead of the project to port Canvas7 to linux. But
unfortunately, they used wine, so I did not get to do a lot of great
gnome hacking like I want to. Canvas7 is a corel draw like mixture of
gimp and dia, or photoshop and illustrator, in case you've never heard
of it.

Anyway, I'm really hoping to help with this project. I've wanted to get
into some open source projects for a long time, but this one is
particularly exciting. The office I work in is married to outlook, and
its frequently a thing people tell me they can't live without and
therefore could never switch to linux. So I'd love to see a outlook
compatible program with all or more of the features it has! Since its so
hard to get people to transition from their software, outlook
compatibility is important. 

If anyone has any pointers for me, I would greatly appreciate them. I'm
gonna go start looking at the source and looking for imap info now...

Thanks again!
 michael

Hrmmfrmmhmmfrrmmhmmhmmfruuummm...

Oh, excuse me, I had my foot in my mouth. 
Now that I've read a little of the imap documentation, I see there isn't
much need for a "delete from server" option for imap. That must be a pop
option. And looking at the evolution-0.2 announcement on the mailing
list, I see that we only recently got basic imap support thanks to jeff.

I found some imap docs at, who would've guessed? http://www.imap.org

So, I'll continue to read them and try to look at the source. Does
anyone have anything specific in mind for imap? Is there a spec of
desired stuff? 

thanks for the patience,
michael

Well probably not as much as you thought ...

Some users would like to actually have a 'download from server' option -
in effect using imap merely as a receiving spool the same way POP
is generally used.

> I found some imap docs at, who would've guessed? http://www.imap.org

rfc 2060 and related rfc's are good references (no doubt linked
from there).;

Well I think we want it to support everything  in camel, and
support it well :)  Jeff is doing
most of the work right now, eh shoudk now the state, and him, Dan, 
and Ettore shoukd now where its headed.

I know one feature which is missing completely is supporting the
search interface (assuming i just haven't missed it anyway)- Jeff doens't
have an imap server that supports it to test with.  It would
be nice also for it to support a subset of search operations
(those that can be determined from the summary only)
as well, since many imap servers dont support searching.
Not sure if anyones working on it yet, but it shouldn't be
too hard a thing to do (few days work maybe).

 Michael

Subject: [Evolution] imap subfolders

Looking at camel-imap-folder.c, I see that you always check that the
folder name is "INBOX". I'm guessing here that this is why none of the
messages in other folders are being seen. You do this in init,
get_message_count, and some other places. Are you sure that the folder
name handling is correct for the else cases there?

Also, I was trying to find the code for the "get mail" button so I could
track down why we're not getting imap mail. Can anyone point me in the
right direction? I was looking in e-shell-view.c and it looks like it's
the application bar? It that right? And there's a proc somewhere for
it(?)...

thanks
michael

Disconnected IMAP is the most wanted on my list.  This is alot better than 
connected and offline.

ASAIK only tkrat handels this today (when talking about linux/unix-mua's)

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution + HTML

Hi,

I've noticed that evolution was handling html attachment with ease, the
rendering is very nice and efficient. I've made some test with yahoo, altavista etc...
it works great !

I wonder if this html engine can be called anywhere in the gnome environment
using the bonobo component (like explorer in windows) and if there is any plan to
make a gnome html browser available with the evolution html engine ?

Thanks

Eric

I agree. Also, removing the grey lines between each message might make
the shape of the thread clearer (like in Netscape Mail).

On threads, I noticed a couple of minor bugs. Sometimes the messages in
a thread are shown out of order. For example, the reply might come
first, and the original message second. Other times, it shows messages
in the same thread when they should be in different threads. Maybe the
first problem is happening because the code assumes that the mbox is
already sorted by date, or that a reply always has a later date than the
email it is replying to. But that's just a guess.

You shoud rely on draft-crispin-imapv rather than rfc2060, as it specifies
what to do with no us-ascii foldernames, and that sort of thing. You can find
it at: http://www.imc.org/draft-crispin-imapv

Yep, thats the way to do it right now.

It seems 'intuitive'?  Conceptually thats what you're 
doing anyway.  Anyone think of a better way to do the
gui for
this?

Well bascally, 'get mail' is only for pop/local mbox email.
imap merely queries the server for emssages.  get mail is used to
download messages into the local store ...

No, no sorting is expected freom the contents of th emailboxl.

The main criterea used for threading is the messages 'in-rely-to' and
'referendes' headers.  After thats all done, the sorting is based on the 
sent-date.  So yesl, this could be a bit out, since the sent date
depends on the sender having the correct offset from gmt int he
email.

The last criteria used is the subject.  So i find it very unliklely
that you are getting genuinly wrong threaded messages (its using the
same algorithm as used in netscape 3).

Perhaps a reset button next to the search box? I am forced to use M$ outlook
at work, and this was one of the little non-intuitive quirks I had to figure
out, to unfilter your message you have to search for " " ;-)

	I must add that i've observed this behaviour also. I was trying to
reproduce it but evolutions didn't cooperate.

 One thing that i noticed was the following. I am using imap to read the same
folders that balsa does, where procmail delivers the mais. In some folders
there were messages wich were marked as new but i couldn't read it. It looked
like they had been deleted but there was still a record of their presence.
Folders with this problem also showed the above behavior.

	I'll try to get a screenshot and then i'll post an url to it.

	See y'a

Hi,

I have compiled without problems all sources, but
evolution don't work. 
I received this message on my console:
Bonobo-WARNING **: Can not resolve initial reference to RootPOA
and a window with this message :  Cannot initialize bonobo system 

Did you have any idea? I could try to debug, but i don't find the option
in the configure to add the option -g in the compilation of source.

Thanks for your help

I'm checking to see if the mailbox name is "INBOX", yes. This is because
that is the ONLY folder that doesn't ever have a namespace. The rest of
the folders I need to prepend the namespace to before selecting it. And
I have no idea what you're talking about when you say "I'm guessing here
that this is why none of the messages in other folders are being seen."
If it's not working for you then please send me debug output? This works
for me and everyone else who's tried IMAP in Evolution recently.

Get Mail has nothing to do with IMAP currently, we may at some point
make it so that clicking on Get Mail will reload the IMAP folder
summary, but it would be better if I could get this working
automatically when we get new mail on the server. This is one of the few
parts of IMAP that needs to be coded (other than disconnected IMAP).

I don't appreciate the sarcasm especially since this is not the fault of
my imap code, and you can easily fix this by hand editing the
~/evolution/config file and appending the correct namespace to the
"source=" line

eg, mine looks like: source=imap://fejj@trna.helixcode.com/mail

We may even have this working in the mail-config code by now, it seems
as 
though it was working last night but I have yet to actually test it
myself.

Hopefully that helps

This usually means you compiled some parts against oaf and some
against goad. You will need to rebuild the parts you built against
goad.

If you re-sort the message list (by clicking on one of the headings),
then threading will break (in 0.2). Unsorting it (by right-clicking
the heading and choosing "Unsort") will fix it.

DO NOT do that! Evolution does not do any locking of its own files,
and if you change them while it is running, it may later overwrite
parts of them with "wrong" data.

What you want to do is to use procmail to filter mail into one mbox,
and then tell Evolution to fetch mail from that mbox into its own.

What does "Status: RO" mean? (That's not part of any standard AFAIK.)

> How will the way Evolution handles scripts/html/executables
> be different than that of Outlook/Outlook Express?

HTML: GtkHTML does not currently support javascript. If it does in the
future, Evolution will disable that. Evolution does not currently
fetch remote images in HTML message bodies, because that can be used
by spammers to verify that you've received the message. (At some
point, it will be possible to tell Evolution "ok, load the images",
but currently there's no way to do it.)

Scripts/executables: Evolution does not and will not have the ability
to run scripts/executables attached to messages. There is the problem
of, eg, an Excel document with a malicious VB script in it. This needs
to be dealt with by the app being used to display the attachment. (In
this case, Gnumeric, which will use GNOME BASIC to safely run the VB
script without damage to your environment.) But this means that any
program used to display an attachment needs to be audited to make sure
it's safe against malicious data.

 Actually I was kidding you, but technically it was
sarcasm. Yep it isn't your code, and I fixed it by
going the full path thinggy a couple of days ago.

 But this led me to: why the heck doesn't starmail of
the very bloated StarOffice spend so much time on my
imap even though I didn't give it any namespace? 

 The answer is because it defaults to:

 INBOX, Trash

 and that's it. Now It shows me a list in an option
window so that I could "subscribe" to folders. Exactly
like Netscape news thing. But it somehow is faster
since it doesn't try to download all the folders at
once (like netscape and evolution do) but each when
needed (when a dir is expanded in other words it will
fetch it one level down and stop). I think in the end
this approach is faster. 


 Peace

Subject: [Evolution] Default VFolders

 This might have been discussed to death. But in case
it wasn't I think the following would be nice for the
vfolder trick to be cool.

 Highlight the from address in each message and give
it a callback so that by left-clicking I'd jump into a
temporary vfolder containing all this person's mail.
By right-clicking I'd be able to create a permanent
vfolder for this person or add this person to my
address book.

 Have default unread vfolder.

 Same of course goes for sent messages. Say I want to
look for messages I sent to foo.....

We'll have categories for calendar events & todo items.
Chris Lahey has written a nice category editor for the address book, which
we'll probably pinch (is that what you were referring to?).
We just need to change the default list of categories for this.

I'm creating a new dialog to edit tasks now, so I'll probably add it.

I have a bunch of folders on my company's outlook server. They show up 
in the folder bar as being at the same level as the inbox but they're 
empty. Should I look into this or is there something else thats more 
pressing? What parts are you working on, I don't want to dupilcate any 
effort.

Yeah, that method may be faster and we may want to do that eventually.
Currently, though, the front-end is not very imap loving :-)
We'll be fixing this as we go... Hopefully by M3 IMAP will be integrated
more smoothly.

It's known that Evolution has issues with Exchange servers, if you
happen to figure out the problem great, if not we'll be installing an
Exchange server locally here that I can use to help debug.

Yes. I thought Federico wrote it. Chris did a very nice job!

Very nice. Good luck.

Subject: [Evolution] calendar appointments with attached notes

Hello.

I've been trying Evolution (the 0.2 RPMS) and so far I like it.

The calendar program on my Palm Pilot allows notes of an arbitrary
length to be attached
to an appointment. Is there any way to do that in the Evolution
calendar, or is this feature
planned for the future?

By the way, the thing that excites me the most about Evolution is the
prospect of
being able to use a M$ Exchange server's calendar, address book, and
e-mail
services from a Linux workstation. If that pans out, my wife won't have
any excuses
left for continuing to use Windows!

Thanks.

--Tony

This is planned, and will be in place with the new iCalendar support.
Basically you just stick your text in the DESCRIPTION field of an
iCalendar component.

Nothing in this example, of course - but then, that was sent using mutt.
The message I sent before that was sent with evolution, and had a From
line of

From: <>

(which is why it was filled in to "evolution-admin" by the mailing list
software) even though I had correctly set my identity.

First of all, well done to evolution developers. It is looking good.

Now to my question. I used evolution to read mail from my local inbox in
/var/spool/mail

It has taken all the mail and converted it to a different format. Is the
new format some standard format, and is there a utility to convert it back
so that I can use pine to access those messages which were still in my
inbox?

Guy.

It hasn't really changed the format.  pine is just more particular
ab out what it epects as a From line.  Look back in the message
archives, someone had something for this.

What if you only took away the lines from within a thread but there would still
be lines between messages which arent in the thread? Is that what you meant?

mutt (& some other mailers) use it in the header to indicate that the
message is O[ld] (a message becomes old when you leave the mailer, whether
its read or not.) and R[ead]

the solution i came up with was this:

create a user 'bob' in my normal user's group, w/ just pop access.
make /var/spool/mail/bob group-writeable

put this at the top of my ~/.procmailrc:

:0 Dc:
/var/spool/mail/bob

set evolution to pull mail from 'bob's pop account.

and that works.

Subject: [Evolution] Thoughts on Preview 0.2

Hello,

I've been using Evolution Preview 0.2 for the last few days and would
like to offer some feedback mostly on UI issues. I'm sure that a
number of these issues are already planned to be addressed in future
releases, but I thought I'd bring them up before it's too late, so to
speak.

  My primary machine is a thinkpad 240 which has a rather tiny screen
  measuring in at 800x600. Evolution uses a lot of extraneous screen
  space which makes reading mail less efficient. These suggestions
  might help tighten up the use of space.

    * The button bar beneath the menu. I hope that it will be possible
      to a) hide the text, b) hide the icons, c) hide the whole
      bar. These button's actions would be soon replaced by
      function-key combinations for many people.

    * The shortcut bar. This uses up an incredible amount of screen
      space for limited functionality. Again, here it'd be nice to be
      able to hide the icons, text or both. A horizontal orientation,
      maybe at the bottom of the window I think would work better. The
      icons could highlight depending on which component you're using
      at the moment. (small icons)

    * It would be nice to be able to change the list and message
      default font sizes.

    * The various druids pop up many many many dialog boxes. I think
      many of these could be better integrated as fields rather than
      independent dialogs. Tabbed dialog boxes would also help reduce
      clutter.

 Other UI ideas:

    * along the grey bar where it says "inbox": What if the "inbox"
      was really a pop-up menu which let you choose between your
      folders? This would save me lots of space.

    * once a search is completed successfully, a
      button/key-combo/menu-item to turn that search into a virtual
      folder.

    * Can I Vfolders encompass everything. I.E. Everything (contacts,
      emails, chats, appointments) with Big Boss?

    * I'd like to be able to drag and drop emails into folders.

 Minor issues:

    * When I select Tools->Filter Druid... (or VFolder Druid), the
      dialog box which appears has a misleading descriptor. Shouldn't
      it be "Select rule" rather than Select rule type"? Isn't it
      displaying the rules which are already set up for filtering
      rather then categories for rules? or am I missing something.
      Also, in this dialog box, it would default to a quick glance
      what my filter are, so rather than listing them by type, it'd be
      nice to see their descriptions filled in. I.e. If I have a
      filter "Copy incoming messages from a certain address to
      specific folder" can it default to the supplied values: "Copy
      incoming messages from 'Anne Hunter' to 'trash'"

    * When selecting multiple messages, it would be nice if the read
      status would not be changed. When I select a bunch of mails,
      it's usually to refile them, and I don't want their "read"
      status changed.

    * When refiling, only the folders of the correct type should show
      up. If I can't move my email to my contacts, why am I even given
      the choice?

I am terrificly impressed with the work the Evolution team has
done. My commendations on your progress. I hope these suggestions are
useful.

       Rony

This seems to work:

sed -e 's/^From - $/From foo@bar  Wed Jul 19 08:52:14 2000/' \
~/evolution/local/Inbox/mbox | formail -I 'From ' -s formail \
>newmbox

Or if you don't mind all the "From " lines containing junk, just
do the sed part :)

By the way, would it be possible for Evolution to generate
"^From " lines of the form "From user@host  `date`"?  Even if
"From - " is valid, pine, elm, mutt, formail etc. don't think
it is.  It would be nice to interoperate better with other
MUA's.

Well, a workaround for this is to drag the toolbar out of the
window.  (Drag the vertical bar on the left of the toolbar.)
Then just bring the window to the front again.  :)

Well, you can hide the whole thing by clicking on
View|Show shortcut bar.

Outlook can be made to do this.  I think it would be useful.

My 2 cents.  I use Outlook at work and Netscape 4.7 at home.  Both will
show me (at times) the reply before the original, so I am guessing it's
the user having the wrong time for thier client (as was mentioned
before)...

I assume it's so that you don't have your POP/IMAP passwds
hanging around in memory and also so that if you leave your desk
for a bit, but don't log out/lock your display, nobody else can
download your mail and read it while you're gone :)

Then again, if you're going to go to the trouble of "forgetting"
your passwords before you leave, you may just as well lock your
desktop...

Please someone correct me if I'm wrong.

 Why movemail?

 Why the heck can't email apps read the sys mail in
/var/whatever/mail instead of moving it to their
folder?

 Netscape does this, evolution does this, others need
imap access to localhost for God's sake!

 This is ugly. If I am away, can't connect via X to my
machine or for any other reason, then I can't use
pine, elm or any other email tool to read system mail,
no instead I need to change folders and such to get to
that mail.

 Why? Why? Why?

Seems like an interface issue. How about a feature that says "On startup,
go to this folder". Solves the problem isn't it since your concern seems
to be having to change folders.

Yeah!  You should just do what Netscape does!

Oh wait.

Netscape supports an external movemail.

You can do this by putting the appropriate categories in your
contacts.  I have my own "groupies" category, but alas, Evolution
keeps displaying an empty set for it.

If we eventually use a GtkHTML component to edit the long description,
how is this going to work with the Palms? They can only handle plain
text, right?

I suppose we can convert to plain text to send to the Palm, but if
the description is edited on the Palm any formatting may be lost.
Just warn the user?

Subject: [Evolution] New user setup and existing vCards

I just downloaded and installed Evolution 0.2.  The new user setup 
script worked well, and things seem to be running smoothly.  I 
copied my existing gnomecal vCal file over "~/evolution/local/Calenda
r/calendar.vcf"; however, the addressbook seems to be in database 
format.  How do I incorporate my existing vCards into Evolution 
without reentering the data (or some other piece-meal method)?  Is 
there a script out there to insert the vCards in my GnomeCard file 
into the database?

I know Evolution is far from production-ready, but I would like have 
a bunch of data around to test Evolution in a more realistic manner.

Regards,

Erm. I didn't say it was impossible. I said it was "hard to do". Which
file locking mechanism do you suggest we use for mail? I'm largely
unfamiliar with Python so I have no idea how they do it in a portable
fashion.

I guess if the user tries to sync back an object from the Pilot that
already exists in Evolution, and if the Evolution object has HTML data
in it, we can put up a warning to tell the user that the new
description will lose all HTML information.

Most of the time this should not be a problem; only people with too
much time in their hands (i.e. those who do not need a calendar) spend
the time to put bold and italic and fonts in their appointment
descriptions :-)

I can't judge unless I see it, but it might work.

I meant to have a flat background with no lines anywhere. This is how
netscape mail does it, and I find it easier to read. Maybe it is also
because I prefer the font netscape uses (can we configure this in
evolution too?)

X-Mailer: Balsa 0.9.0

I think on of my main attractions to Evolution, concerning the GUI, was that it
had lines like Outlook Express 5 for MacOS. Which for me is easier to read
because it just looks nicer, in my opinion. But, I am using Balsa which doesn't have
lines and it works just fine for basic mailing needs. It's just so confusing to
have it all packed into one field and not seperated. But I think that because of
the way widgets are set up we would either have to add a lot more code for
options or just leave it the way it is right now.

Does Outlook Express have a threaded view? If so, how does it display
it?

 I am not an expert at this. The only I worried about
file locking, I discovered under python that there was
a posix way of doing this. Now all unix's and even
windows nt are posix compliant.

 Python always provide a layer to make things
portable. Anyway, as far as I know the module is
called fcntl and is an interface to UNIX fcntl and
ioctl routines.
 The locking is done via FCNTL.F_SETLK/FCNTL.F_SETLKW.

 That is the most I could get. You'd have to look at
code to see how they make this portable.

Thought so. Take a peek at the URL Jamie posted that dealt with how
Netscape dealt with movemail. Note the comments about fcntl locking and
what happens when you apply it to NFS. This is part of what I was talking
about when I said it's hard to do.

X-Mailer: Balsa 0.9.0

For MacOS in version 5.0 it does. Basically it is like Netscape Communicator,
but it is much more fluent and has lines between each message. It shows them by
date, which can be out of order because of timezones, lag and wrong-set clocks. It
is the exact same way in the OE5 newsreader. The other feature I love about
OE's list display is that you can choose which headers you want to show up. I
should mention that the OE5 display widget is based on MacOS's Finder "Sort/List
View" widget which is much nicer than the actual OE5 thing. 

I really don't think that this is any big deal, it's just a widget and will
probably be changed as Gtk+ progresses and new themes are invented. And it might
just be a lot better for everyone if all of the widgets in Evolution had
_options_. Personally I think every single widget in Gtk+ and all related programs should
have more options! Do any of you remember KDE 1.1.2, the way you could tweak
the widgets? They messed that up in 2.0 but Gtk+ is very flexible and could use
more options. Just add more technical stuff to the "Applications" panel in
"Control Center" <gnomecc> and rename it Widgets.  

I was just wondering, will all the widgets that are in Evolution be availible
through Gtk+ in the future? I really like that Shortcuts bar and would like to
use it in other programs without copying the code. It would be nice to see some of
that as plain old Gtk+ widgets.

I remeber reading about posix compliant and what that means once.  You
wont like the answer but it means next to nothing.

To be posix compliant all the functions must exist, but do not actually
have to function.  So a posix OS might include posix function
wipe_my_drive() that simply returns a fail, and does not even try to
wipe the drive.  

By having the function return a fail code apps that call it wont just
fall over, and thats basicaly what posix is about. 

Corect me if I am way off here, but that my understanding from a single
article.

Yes but locking isn't the only prob lem, with some systems you
need to do the locking as root, or setuid a particular user.
Mail systems generally use .locks anyway.  Its the setuid/setgid
locking/maildrop access that is the bigger problem, but still,
its not that  big if you just move your mail to another database ...

Well the table 'widget' in evolution is 'not just a widget' really, its
a rather specifically written and complex wiget called e-table.

It probably wont be part of gtk, because etable is canvas based, and also GPL
(not lgpl as required for gtk+).  It does everything itslef, including
having pluggable renderers for each part, so it needs stylising differntly.

Why is this? One of the things I like about gtk/gnome is its pervasise
style/behaviour changability. I don't want to have to go about
configuring every little detail just so that it behaves the same.

Ok, I understand there might be many problems.

Now evolution, netscape mail, and others use some
movemail to be able to avoid locking, setuid, setgid
... Great!

Then please move it back once done with it. In other
words fake imap even on systems without imap! This
shouldn't be a problem since those files are local
even though they might be coming from nfs.

Would that be too much work?

Hi.

I installed Evolution 0.2 using the Helix updater as root and pointed it =
to my local mbox (fetchmail grabs from my pop3 servers)  Works great!  =
But when I use my regular (non-root) account on the same box, using the =
same type of setup (local mbox), I get an error every time I try to get =
mail saying that a lock for the /var/spool/mail/myregularuser couldn't =
be created.

The mailbox is okay, I think - I can use Pine with no trouble.  WHERE is =
Evolution trying to create the lock file?  I can probably just chmod =
something to fix this, I think - I just don't know what.

Thanks.

Because no other widget would do the job.  Its really as simple as that.

I dont know the plans in that area, but i presume they will become
more customisable, to match the rest of gtk.

Depending on your system you probably only have to change your
maildrop directory to mode 1777.  e.g. if it is currently

drwxrwxr-x    root    mail

Then you change it to 

drwxrwxrwt    root    mail

Dont use mode 777 as it is a security problem.

This will hopefully be addressed at some point (by 1.0?).

I don't have any clue what you mean by "fake imap".  As for moving it back, 
guess what... you get all the same problems back again. You have to deal with
locking the spool, because while you "moved" the file off into mailreader 
land new mail can have arrived. So now at somepoint to move it back you have 
to: (a) lock the spool. (b) incorperate the spool into your copy of the 
spool in some sesiable way. (c) put your "newer new spool" in place. (d) 
unlock the file so that the MTA can then add any mail that has arrived while
you were incorperating the "new to you, but old to the mta mail". 

By "fake imap" did you mean "create the illusion of folders within a single
file?  Yes that could be done, but it seems like an excessivly bad idea(tm). 

> Would that be too much work? 

Given that it makes the problem harder, I would imagin so..

hi

i have been using evolution it's quite good but also
quite big for machines without a lot of ram, it would
be good if the components (mail, contacts and
calendar) would be launched just when you press the
button to switch to them, not upon startup, that would
reduce memory consumpsion for those of us that just
need to read the email.

i would also be good if it would show a progress bar
when getting the email form the server...

thanks a lot for such a program and keep up the good
work!

Diego

Hi all,

I had a lookup at the latest (packaged) Evolution release yesterday and
I love it :)

I would like to see the IMAP support *greatly* improved though, it
currently does not work for me with Cyrus IMAPd server (it appears to be
using '/' as a path deliminator rather than a '.' which Cyrus uses), it
also seems very inefficient in it's commands, it issues around 4 FETCH's
per message, and even downloads the entire message body .. all the
fetch's could probably be combined by asking for all the info in one
command, and grabbing all the headers before body's.

I really think what the developers are doing with this is great, even
though it's immature I feel it will definitely blow all other graphical
mail clients away in the future :)

Yeah just hold your horses.  We thought it was more importatn
to have an imap that worked at all, rather than worked ideally.
So expect it to improve quite a bit with each next release.

Subject: [Evolution] Debugging libcamel

So, I'm trying to debug the imap problems with exchange servers, but I
can't set a breakpoint in libcamel.
I type 

info shar

and I get a list of a lot of libraries, but no libcamel

so I try shar camel  and shar libcamel  and shar camel.so.0 and many
others... but none work. 

Any ideas how I can debug this lib? Why isn't it loaded, but I'm getting
imap mail?

You are debugging the evolution-=mail program, and not
just 'evolution' i presume?  (since its a non-linked component).

I also usually find i have to break on main beforfe
i can break on shared library symbols, and of course the
dynamically loaded stuff (libcamelimap for example)
you have to wait until its loaded by the application.
gdb goes spastic with the breakpoints if you then run again,
but its doable, if painful.

Indeed, BUT, you have to (or "movemail" has to) lock the mail
spool when you move it out in the first place, so if you can do
it once, why not twice?  I'm not saying it should be done, but
your argument that you can't lock it the second time doesn't
make much sense to me.

Subject: [Evolution] Fix for outlook folders at root level

Ok, I haven't been able to confirm my fix because it semes like none of
the changes I make are making any difference in the output of the
program. Maybe the library is loaded outside of evolution and I need to
force it to unload somehow, but whatever. 

From looking at the debug output, I can se the problem. 

When selecting a folder, which I assume goes to the function
imap_get_summary:
-first you select the folder with the name alone:
ie. for a folder named Storage...

sending: A00079 SELECT Storage

-this succeeds and you examine Storage
-then you status Storage to get the number of mesages. this succeeds
also.
-then, strangely, you select /Storage

sending: A00082 SELECT /Storage

which fails with

recieved: A00082 NO Mailbox name is invalid.

at which point you bail out. All of this takes place in
imap_get_summary, but my changes are apparently not doing anything, and
I can't break into the library yet. I'll keep trying to get it to
compile, I think you just have to change imap_command_extended, which
tries to select the folder first, and is apparently doing it wrong.
Maybe this is just for exchange folders, or maybe its just for folders
at the root level. Not sure yet. 

I'm really enjoying using evolution though. The tree view for replies to
messages is very cool.

Um, I'm not claiming that having to lock the file twice matters.  The 
issue I see is in rebuilding the spool in a way that is sensiable.  I don't
think for example putting the X-MUA-Magic-thingy most clients use to store
metadata belongs back in the spool.  With that said, the move-back would 
have to trim off all of the metadata; which would remove any chance of 
getting virtual-imap.  I assume by virtual-imap you are meaning the ability
to have folders without having folders. 

Maybe If i understood why you want this it would make sense to me; but 
basically I just can't see how it would be useful.

Well, I don't know what is meant by "virtual imap" either.  I'm
not the one who asked the question in the first place.  I was
just questioning what you said about not copying the stuff back
:)

The person who asked initially seemed just to want to be able to
read his mail with something like elm/mutt/pine when he only had
access to the machine via telnet.  As far as I can tell,
"mutt -f ~/evolution/local/Inbox/mbox" should do it as long as
you have everything in the Inbox and use VFolders instead of
"real" folders.  The only thing stopping this is the "From - "
lines that mutt/pine/elm don't like.

Another point, when I create a Mail Folder it doesn't appears ..

Ok dude, I may have a useful suggestion ...

You have to make sure you 'make install' when you change the
codce -= otherwise i think you'll find its running th eold
versionl.  Oh, and you will probably also want to rtun 'killev' - 
otherwise the old components will still be running. (unless they've
crashed).

Give that a go, that will probably helkp your debugging efforts!

I did a make and make install every time I made a change and it didn't show.

How can you print from libraries? I tried

fprintf(stderr, "message");
but I would never see it. Does that just mean I wasn't running my code?

whats killev? there's no man page for it...

Yep, you're right - I was mostly just playing around to get the right info -
the latest code in CVS is a lot more efficient. It will still fetch the
entire message when the user requests it, but in the future it will only
grab the message 'part' that the user requests and cache them for any
future requests.

Are you running the latest CVS? I believe I fixed that problem (I could be
wrong though). I don't believe the problem was in get_summary, it was in
camel_imap_command_extended I believe (and a number of other places
actually).

let me see if I can reconstruct the problem...

problem code:
		if (url && url->path && strcmp (folder->full_name, "INBOX"))
			folder_path = g_strdup_printf ("%s%s%s", url->path + 1, dir_sep,
folder->full_name);
		else
			folder_path = g_strdup (folder->full_name);

fixed code:
		if (url && url->path && *(url->path + 1) && strcmp (folder->full_name,
"INBOX"))
			folder_path = g_strdup_printf ("%s%s%s", url->path + 1, dir_sep,
folder->full_name);
		else
			folder_path = g_strdup (folder->full_name);

let me explain: we need to check that the url path isn't just "/" because
the '/' is really just separates the host from the namespace, take the
following url for example:

imap://fejj@helixcode.com/mail

In this example, "/mail" is the url->path, but we've got to strip the
leading '/' off because that's not really part of the namespace. Now that
you've seen an example of a url with a namespace, lets look at one that
does not contain a namespace:

imap://guest@tazmanian-devil.helixcode.com/

In this example, the imap daemon does not use a namespace but notice that
url->path == "/", now - applying the original code and selecting a folder
called Storage, we get "/Storage"

tada ;-)

Sorry I missed you on IRC this morning

 Indeed, that's all I want. Be able to read my mail
with something else. It sometimes happens. 

 So, lock it or don't lock it or whatever, as long as
I can read my mail with pine, elm.... it's ok. That's
what pisses me for instance about StarOffice mail, it
uses a weird format to store messages.

 I don't know, maybe I am overdoing this, but that'd
be cool.

Subject: [Evolution] Deleteing Messages

HI All

How do I delete messages?  
I have gone and higlighted the message.  
I have clicked delete. 

I still have the messages....  So I click the actions-expunge menu...
I still have the messages.  Any day now I am going to be unable to find
my mail between the old junk.

Also, on a releated note, I like to read a folder, then select the last
message, select the first message and then press delete, but I had to
shift select every single message.  Will this be changed sometime?

And, releated to that, could the helix guys put up a web page of planned
features so that plain old wingeing users like my self can stop
requesting planed features :o)



Lets see, what else can I ask for today....  How about a solid gold
Monkey for all who purchase the CD?

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution through Helix Update

Greetings,

	I saw a message here a few days ago relating to this, but can't
find it now(it's been one of those weeks). 

	Anyway, the point of this message is that I also am unable to
download from the Evolution option under Helix Update. I am running a
pretty much stock (other than helix gnome) Mandrake 7.0 system. I was able
to download Evolution and install it from one of my work machines running
RedHat 6.2. Could it be a problem relating to the distro that a person is
running?

Chuck

Netscape Messenger (win version) shows threads as such I believe with lines drawn like in Evolution
...[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
.........[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
............[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
...............[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
...[HelixCode stuff]
...[golden monkey]

How about just having
...[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
...[HelixCode stuff]
...[golden monkey]
...[HelixCode stuff]

If this comes out unformatted then basically instead of hitting 3 levels deep and indenting each
time for each threaded message just going one level deep for all with lines drawn. 

Also is the DELETE key going to be "smart"?  If one is NOT viewing in threaded mode and sorts based
on FROM....will it skip to Joe's #1 message, Joe's #2, Joe's #3 or will it skip to the next unread
message based upon when received.  It'd be cool if the user sorts...threaded or whatever instead of
having to use the down arrow key to navigate and then hitting the Delete Key to advance to the next
message within the list (whichever way sorted) that the Delete key will SAY ...."hit down arrow key
within the list view and delete the message."  

Currently I believe hitting the delete key skips to the next unread message based upon when received
or perhaps I'm totally off based.

It seems that as most apps evolve they squeeze more features in limited space and thus shrinkify
icons...basically do more with less screen space. To me it gives it more of a polished look. For
example on Red Hat 6.2 python anaconda that snake's icons are HUGE.  I wish they would shrink them a
tad and decrease the line space between the fields so one wouldn't have to scroll so much, etc.

How about saving some screen space in Evolution.  I seem to always hide the shortcut bar...either
squeeze it thin perhaps like a slim jim...or how about super-dinky icons (or no icons) along with
text [Inbox, Calendar, Contacts] on the dark grey status bar which current shows which folder you
are in.

And then how about changing the 'display current folder' location to the same light grey bar as
SEARCH is on the far left next to the big X.

Speaking of actions-expunge, it takes evolution 43 seconds to expunge
one message from my mbox, which contains about 4000 messages. Also, Get
mail took 38 seconds to get one message from a server on the same LAN.
Is this a fundamental problem with storing all email messages in a
single file, or can it be worked around? If not, how about storing each
email in a separate file?

If you're using IMAP, it doesn't support expunge in 0.2, to protect
your mail from Evolution bugs.

Those mean different things... in the first, you have a message, and a
reply to it, and a reply to the reply. In the second, you have a
message and two replies to that message.

This is important for when a particular thread of a conversation turns
useless. You can then skip all further messages in that thread and
pick up again at the next message that is outdented far enough.

> Also is the DELETE key going to be "smart"?

Yes, it's a bug that Delete and N and P don't follow the visual order
right now.

> How about saving some screen space in Evolution. I seem to always

Yeah, so does everyone else, AFAIK.

The former is. To expunge a message, it needs to copy the entire mbox
to a temp file without the expunged message, and then move it back. So
this will be slow.

Getting mail being slow is probably a bug.

> If not, how about storing each email in a separate file?

Yes, there will probably be MH and/or maildir providers eventually.

The UW IMAP also doesn't seem to support delete on mh
folders.

(But I'd be delighted to be proved wrong, or to learn
of versions that do.)

Seems to be a missing feature.  I can delete all I want in a Vfolder and
it 
wont work, but if I delete in the Vfolder, go to the Inbox and expunge
all is fine.

Reading Radagasts article on advogato made me think of an interface idea
that I've had for some time now that would likely be handy for the majority
of GUI apps.

Many Unix users desire the efficiency of the CLI, whereas a GUI often has a
much shallower learning curve.  Thus I propose the following...

A widget that is the equivalent to the command line, where one enters
commands in it just as any other command line interface.  It could be
invoked by a key combination and just hover at the bottom of the screen, and
probably only be one or two lines tall (just as the input box for IRC
clients...).  It would lose focus or disappear by another key combination
(for those tasks with which the GUI is more efficient...).   It would likely
not be out by default, but if it were a consistent command to invoke it, it
would likely be adopted by many projects, and used by many powerusers.

What do you think?

This is a useful gadget.  Emacs provides two variants of this -- M-x
for "simple" commands (where you just need to specify the command to
invoke), and M-: for more complex commands, where you can enter any
elisp expression and emacs will evaluate it.

(vi also provides the same thing, but I'm an Emacs user, so I'll stay
with what I know.)

The second (more general) form of course requires fairly powerful
scripting support in the application.  This is more work, but it pays
off very quickly for power users.

One thing I like about the way that emacs provides this functionality
is that it can be invoked by a keypress regardless of what is
currently in your main buffer.  So it's context-insensitive, even if
some of the commands you can invoke through it do depend on context.
This is critical to making it useful to those power users -- if I had
to click on a text box to invoke the commands, I'd probably leave
emacs for vi :)

Can you create a terminal version?  Seriously, I would like 
scripting capabilities external to Evolution, no matter what 
language it's in.  This way, things can be done unattended by power 
users.  Perhaps Evolution and the terminal tool, say "evoctl", could 
communicate via a pipe or IPC..  Or, say when Evolution is not 
running, evoctl could be a front end to capabilities in Camel.

Caveat:  I am new to Evolution, and some of my ideas might not be 
self-consistent or feasible.

Oaf has stupidly been setup to make with -Werror in its

remove -Werror from the CFLAGS variable.

Subject: [Evolution] Interoperability API / Protocol ? Which way ?

Hi,

i'm working in a firm which developped an online Agenda (+AddressBook)
I'm not here to make an advert for it but to ask a few questions :

We're developping 'synchronisers' (aka small plug-ins to make your
offline and your online agenda in Sync). For the Windows platform, we're
Ok :

we've just finished with the one for Outlook (97 & 2000), Outlook
Express & Palm are on the Way. But as i use Linux to develop this agenda
(the online one), i'd like to sync it with whatever Organizer/Agenda
lives on Linux.

	As Evolution would replace (for me) GnomePIM and Balsa, i'd like to
sync it with my Linux offline agenda.

So my question is : how should i attack Evolution internals ?

For Outlook, that was OLE_Automation/COM, for OE it was MAPI, for Palm
it's a conduit, for Exchange it's CDO ...

Should i use CORBA ? Should i make adds to Evolution source ? Would
there be a plug-in system (one for Palm, one for whatever online agenda
you want ...) ? Should i use iCalendar ?

Anyway, you're making good work. That's really close to Outlook
(graphically). Would it be accessible via a scripting language ? (did i
say gb ??)

Bye and thanks for any response

Thanks for the tip. it now (seems to) installs no problem.
BUT now I am stuck on the ./configure step with evolution.
When running ./configure I get the following error message:

checking for pilot-link version >= 0.9.3... configure: error: pilot-link
0.9.3 required

I do not need this, can it be switched off??
It is installed via rpm from Helix-Gnome and I have also downloaded the
tarball and installed but get the same error when going back to ./configure
with evolution.
Any ideas would be appreciated......nearly there.....
dave.

Subject: [Evolution] Cant run evo

Just downloaded the evolution 0.2 files (all rpms, but compiled the evolution
code from source), but when I run evolution, I get:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751
d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

So, how can I "set OAF_INFO_PATH" to get it running ?

Cheers,

almost there, I hope!!!
OK, now I have all required packages installed and evolution seems to

But when I try to run Evolution it crashes with a segment fault immediately,
error message below:

You basically have to talk to the wombat (the Evolution server that
handles the calendar and the addressbook) for doing syncing.

The documentation is unfinished, but it will be worked on. In the
meantime, I can tell you we have people working on Palm Pilot
synchronization already (the code should be ready for consumption
relatively soon), and that their work will probably be a good example of
how to get things to work.

The "Maybe..." bit is assuming that the shell couldn't launch
evolution-mail. But you will also get that error if evolution-mail
crashed immediately after launching. If so, there should be some other
interesting error message printed somewhere before that one...

Hi !

When I send html mails with Evolution, I'd like to have my own defaults
(background/text/link colors). I tried to emulate this by saving an empty page with the
right settings in the editor, but when I reload it, the link color is replaced
by the text color. It's a bug ! :o)

If you 're using bash do:

if OAF is installed on /usr/local

Subject: [Evolution] Java interfaces for Message Server and so on?

I am not sure if this is relevant.  You feedback is appreciated.
The quoted article mentions Java APIs that might be useful for
integrating Evolution within enterprise IT systems.

Quoted from:
http://www.anchordesk.co.uk/anchordesk/commentary/columns/0,2415,7102840-3,00.html

Subject: [Evolution] IMAP nits.

This is looking good. A few nits, though:

I tested IMAP with the U Washington server on my local system.
To make my unix folders in ~/Mail show up as IMAP folders, I had to
enter "//home/jk/Mail" as path. The extra / can't be right.

I had to stop and start Evolution for the configuration to "take".

The IMAP INBOX no longer showed up when I set the path. I guess the
path is intended to be the personal namespace as specified in RFC
2342. If so, this is a bug. RFC 2342 specifies that INBOX must appear
within the personal namespace.

I tried to add another mail source with no path to get at INBOX. But
then the original mail source had disappered next time I started
evolution.

With no path, evolution asks the server to list all files on my
account. There's a lot of them, so there should be a limit. (I guess
you are planning to add the "only list subscribed" option at some
point, but a limit would be useful anyway, or at least a way to tell
it to stop.)

Tha mail source type is called IMAPv4. In fact, from reading the code
it looks like Evolution only supports IMAPv4rev1. IMAPv4 is an
obsolete variant which nobody uses - except my wife! I guess I can
come up with some code for plain IMAPv4 if there is any interest - I
have contributed IMAPv4 support to mutt in the past.

The ability to have a cron job import mail in to the beast rather than
turn up after a weekend and wait 5 mins while it imports N hundred
emails would be the first thing I would setup...  I hate loading
netscape, and having it hog the processor for a minute while it imports
a few hundred mails.  It's simply ugly, and ugly is often bad.

Also, one could have said script running every 5 mins, and as well as
importing, notify of important email without having to start evolution. 
Kind of like the reminders from outlook at the moment, though way more
usefull. Who wants to be reminded of an apointment when you could have a
message pop up telling you some jokes have arrived!

Anybody's open to create a terminal version, fortunately
we've done most of the hard work :)

As for background importing, well maybe at some
point, but not just yet.  Its certainly possible, but
I would suggest it can wait till post 1.0.

Subject: [Evolution] User defined lists and text fields

Something that would be really cool to have, would be user defined pull down
lists.

Thus, say I'm in the construction industry, and I deal with five primary
types of professionals.  Then I would like to define a new pull down list as
Profession - and add the elements of {Architect, Mechanical Engineer, Mason,
Electrical Engineer}.  Also, if in the future I start dealing with other
professions, I would like to append {Plumber, Landscaper, etc.}

This would make Evolution vastly more flexible than any of the other contact
managers out there, and would make it quickly customizable by profession.
(Much more so than just user defined fields, something which some contact
managers already have...).

It would also be cool to have user defined free text fields.  (Not just a
notes field necessarily.  There are category specific notes that I would
like to define in order to reduce the search area/time, as well as ease
report making, and exporting...)

Thus it would be relatively trivial to for any user to imitate any of the
current Contact Managers and to add any customization that would be valuable
for them.  This is something that will knock all of the other contact
managers out of the park...  (Incidentally, I've been doing a review of
contact managers and 'Business Intelligence', Customer Relations Management
(CRM), and Technical Support software (most of which are just glorified
contact managers...) software for my company.  They generally are inflexible
and have horrid UIs, but they all have a few features that are invaluable to
an industry niche, and thus capture a small corner of the market.  With
these additional features, we should be able to be 'all things to all
people' in  extremely short order and without any need for advanced skills.

Thanks for listening,

--0-846930886-964533725=:16894
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


 
I've been trying to compile the Evolution package, I've compiled all the dependant packages and they compiled properly. When I tried to compile Evolution, it requested GConf and gconf-config. I then installed GConf and it compiled properly. I retried to compile Evolution and it kept telling me that it couldn't find GConf 0.5 (which is the version that I compiled). I used the PREFIX option on ./configure where prefix=/usr. GConf is actually in /usr/bin and Evolution shoud have picked it there.


Am I missing something here ? I'm running on Helix Gnome. Besides that missing piece, I'm almost ready to test Evolution. An answer would be deeply appreciated.

Thank you

Make sure you have removed the 'config.cache' file in te top of
the build tree, it sounds like it didn't find it, then
is now caching it and isn't seeing the installation (from the
steps you've outlined at least).

You don't need to specify the full path, you can setup your source as:
source=imap://user@host/Mail

that will work, and remember: the first '/' is a separator and NOT treated
as part of the namespace, that's why you found you needed "//"

Oh, hmmm - you probably did this through the editor - ok, the editor is
"broken" as it does need the first char to be a /, I'll have to see if I
can't get it so that is automagically assumed

I don't see why it souldn't show the INBOX... always works for me

This is because Evolution can't handle more than 1 server right now (this
will change in the near future)

Yes, currently it's just using a LIST instead of an LSUB command, until we
have a way to subscribe in the UI, I will probably leave it as LIST

Yes, I'm basing this on IMAPv4rev1
I could probably add support for v4 also

I was wondering if you could give me more info on widget/applet on that is used

right? Is it dependant on Evolution? Will it be usable in other applications besides
Evolution?

OK,
I have got rid of the error message:

OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443
751d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

by deleting my evolution directory in my home folder and typing:

export OAF_INFO_PATH=/usr/local/share/oaf

in a shell prompt.

But now when I try to run evolution I do not get a crash, it recreates the
evolution folder in my home doirectory, but nothing else happens!!!

any solutions, please????

Dave.

It could be a permission problem. 
I had two hosts: one with a working Evolution, on the other only root
could use it (it crashed with the same message as yours).
I got it working by changing owners and modes ;-)

So my current configuration is as follows:

oaf installed in /usr/share/oaf and /usr/bin/oaf*
evolution on /usr/bin/evo*

/usr/bin/oaf* 	--> 555 bin bin
/usr/share/oaf 	--> 755 root root
/usr/share/oaf/* 	--> 444 bin bin
/usr/bin/evo*	--> 755 root root

Hope it helps.

Subject: [Evolution] Exchange.

I have an exchange server I installed at a client's site.  I set up all the
workstations running Outlook 2000.  Evolution looks a lot like Outlook 2000.
I was wondering what type of support if any will be developed to support
Exchange. You guys are doing a great job so far.  I'll definatly be using
evolution as my Mail and Contacts manager at the office.

If somebody will post something and call it an "official" answer, I think
it's time to start making a FAQ.  There seem to be a lot of people asking
the same questions over and over here, and I'm sure everybody is as tired of
it as I am.  :-)  I can put it together, or maybe Aaron wants to do that,
either way, it should get linked from the Evolution homepage.  Thoughts?

Ah, but that assumes people will read it.

From http://www.helixcode.com/apps/evolution-faq.php3, which has been
there for two months or so, linked prominently from the main Evolution
page:

  My company uses Microsoft Exchange (or Lotus Notes). Will I be able to
  replace my Windows machine with a Linux machine running
  Evolution? 
	We will support as many (useful) open protocols as we can, but
	the first release will most likely not be able to interoperate
	with all of the features of various closed proprietary systems.

X-Mailer: Evolution 0.3 (Developer Preview)
From: Ettore Perazzoli <ettore@helixcode.com>
Date: 27 Jul 2000 19:19:33 -0100
Mime-Version: 1.0
Subject: [Evolution] Evolution 0.3 "Jellyfish" is released

Hello,

the crazy monkeys have done it again: a new development snapshot
release of the Evolution groupware suite (0.3, code name "Jellyfish")
is out.

Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, and addressbook application.
This is mostly a bugfix release.

* Availability

        You can get the Evolution 0.3 tarball here:

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/evolution

        Evolution also requires the latest versions of GtkHTML (0.5),
        Bonobo (0.16), OAF (0.4), GNOME VFS (0.2), GConf (0.5),
        libunicode (0.4), GNOME Print (0.20) and ORBit (0.5.3).

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gtkhtml
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/bonobo
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/oaf
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gnome-vfs
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/GConf
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/libunicode
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnome-print
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/ORBit

* Changes since version 0.2

        Shell:

          - Pop-up folder selection.  (Ettore)

          - Added support for multiple views.  (Ettore)

          - Added support for saving component-specific settings, and
            some initial code to save the view's configuration.
            (Ettore)

          - Fixed the Bonobo menu code so that it works with all the
            locales.  (Ettore)

        Mailer:

          - Lots of IMAP fixes.  (Jeff) 

          - You can use an external setuid/setgid movemail program
            (although we don't ship our own yet). If you have one
            installed with emacs, the configure script will find
            that. Otherwise, you can specify --with-movemail=/path.
            (Dan)

          - You can toggle HTML/plain text for an individual message
            in the composer now.  (Ettore)

          - Bonobo embedding sort of works again, but there are
            problems with size allocation somewhere. Attachments can 
            now also be handled by external applications.  (Dan)

          - text/plain mail is now line-wrapped in the mail display,
            to deal with people who don't put newlines in their mail.
            (Dan)

          - Allow user to specify IMAP namespace in the mail config
            dialog.  (Dan, Jeff)

          - Quoted-printable encoder fixes.  (Michael Zucchi)

          - Various NNTP fixes, include a news pane in the config
            dialog.  (Chris Toshok)

          - Some memory corruption fixes.  (Peter Williams)

          - Fix for message not being re-drawn as deleted.  (Peter
            Williams, Jeff)

          - Moving a message to another folder copies the flags now
            (Jeff)

          - Close signature in HTML mail with </PRE>, not <PRE>, and
            default to ~/.signature.  (Michael Meeks)

          - Fixed some confusing behavior in the message threading
            algorithm.  (Dan)

	  - Improvements to the item selection code.  (Chris Lahey)

        Calendar:

          - Added support for a bunch of iCalendar properties.
            (Federico)

          - Conduit for synchronizing the calendar with gnome-pilot
            (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Seth)

          - ETable-based to-do list view ("taskpad"), for your viewing
            pleasure.  (Damon)

        Addressbook:

          - Conduit for synchronizing the addressbook with gnome-pilot
            (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Chris Toshok)

          - Fixed some random crashes.  (Chris Lahey)

          - Implemented a vCard Bonobo control so that we can support
            inline vCard viewing in the mailer.  (Chris Lahey)

          - Quick search looks at both the name and the company
            name now.  (Chris Lahey)

          - Added more functionality to the contact editor's toolbar.
            (Chris Lahey)

          - Support for printing single cards.  (Chris Lahey)

* Mailing lists

        You can subscribe to the Evolution developers list or the
        Evolution users list by going to the Evolution home page on
        http://www.helixcode.com/apps/evolution.php3

Please note that this is still software in development and should not
be used for production work.  We appreciate testers and contributors,
but please remember that Evolution will still be buggy, incomplete,
and temperamental.

Thanks to the many people who have sent in suggestions and fixes.

(And of course, this announcement was sent with Evolution. :-))

Enjoy,
  The Evolution team.

Subject: [Evolution] evolution 0.3 mbox config bug

Yay. Our first 0.3 bug: If you configure an mbox mail source in either
the config druid or the config dialog box, you need to start the path
with two slashes rather than one. (Eg, "//var/spool/mail/danw", which
will result in a URL of mbox:///var/spool/mail/danw.)

Subject: [Evolution] Printing

In both 0.2 and 0.3 I have problems printing mail messages. 

In both cases the print preview and the printed page have a solid black
band across the top of the page. this extends from one side to the
other, and is about 2 1/2 inches tall.
Printing from the calendar and the address book would appear to work
without any problems.

I think I've just fixed this in CVS, from the testing I've done it seems to

Gee, here's another reason to drop the ridiculous policy of mangling
the subject to include the list name:

Sigh, "mbox" instead of "mailbox"?

Unless there's some good reason to do otherwise, and I sincerely doubt
that there is, you should do mailbox URLs compatibly with Netscape 3.

The mailbox: URL is a way of referring to local mail folders, and to
messages within them.  

In 2.0 and 3.0:

  mailbox:pathname		refers to the folder itself.
  mailbox:pathname?id=xxx	refers to a message by ID.
  mailbox:pathname?number=n	refers to a message by number (the
				first message in the folder is 0,
				the second message is 1, etc.)
  mailbox:pathname?id=xxx&number=n    is the same as the "number=n"
				form if and only if message N has the
				ID xxx; else it is the same as the
				"id=xxx" form.  (This is for
				distinguishing between two messages
				with the same id.)

4.0 broke this, making both the "id" and "number" parameters manditory;
changing the "number" parameter from a *message number* to *byte
offset*; and making it impossible to refer to arbitrary files as
mailboxes (you can only refer to files that are under your mail
directory, because of their pathetic database usage.)

To those URLs, you can append some other parameters that override
the various display options on the View menu:

  &headers=all			show all headers
  &headers=some			show interesting headers
  &headers=micro		show the one-line header display

  &part=n.m			display a specific sub-part of a MIME
				message.  The numbers indicate the
				index in the tree.

  &rot13=true			rotate the characters in the text parts

  &inline=true			try and display attachments inline
  &inline=false			don't display attachments inline

Note that the mailbox: url doesn't talk about attachments at all.
It *only* lets you index messages in mbox folders.

Modulo the way 4.x screwed things up, mailbox: was identical to the
file: URL, with the exception that A: it was presented differently,
and B: you could use ?id= and/or ?number= to reference messages in
the (mbox) file by message-id or positional index (or both, with
error-checking.)

I lied a little bit above: all the attachment stuff (part=1.2.3 and so
on) is actually a part of libmime -- those parameters are parsed by *the
thing that displays messages*, not by *the thing that extracts messages
from folders*.  That's why ?part= works with news: urls too -- that's
not built into the URL handler for news: (or mailbox:) but into the
content-type handler for message/*.

Likewise, if you have a HTTP server (or a local file extension) that
returns documents of type message/rfc822, those will be displayed by
libmime, and URLs like http://foo/bar.msg?part=1.2&inline=false will
just magically work.

Note that the traditional syntax would be "mailbox:/a/b/c" 
(or "mbox:/a/b/c") as in "file:/a/b/c".  Saying "mailbox://a/b/c"
would imply that "a" is a hostname, not a path component.

Netscape interprets "file://localhost/a/b/c" the same as
"file:/a/b/c" and interprets "file://foo/a/b/c" the same as
"ftp://foo/a/b/c".

If you go to 'query bug reports', and just select
the default (or maybe add 'fixed' bugs), it will
give you alist of all of the outstanding ones.

Subject: [Evolution] crash when adding new contact

[I'm not sure if I should be submitting this bug report using a tool....]

I just downloaded the 0.3 Evolution Debian packages. The Help->About Evolution
menu confirms that it is version 0.3. I'm running it on a Debian Woody system.

anyway, I start Evolution, click on the Contacts icon, click on the Full Name
button, type in my first and last name, then click OK.

Then I see the red circle with a yellow bar in it. The debug message reads:

'Application "evolution-addressbook" (process 2706) has crashed due to a fatal
error. (Segmentation fault)

This is with a "clean" Evolution system. I haven't added any address book or
calendar entries yet.

[I can't really submit a bug report from that dialog since mail isn't
configured]

thanks for the great work! I'm hoping to start using Evolution regularly just as
soon as it stabilizes a bit more.

cheers,
david

Exactly. The problem is that a bug was introduced into the config
dialog at the last minute that resulted in the path having an extra /
prefixed, so you type /a/b/c and it mistakenly ends up generating
mbox://a/b/c, which the URL code misinterprets. Adding the extra slash
in gets you mbox:///a/b/c, which as you mentioned is equivalent to
mbox://localhost/a/b/c, aka mbox:/a/b/c.

As for "mbox" rather than "mailbox", that's just how Bertrand wrote it
long ago. I hadn't actually realized Netscape used URLs to refer to
mailboxes. There's no reason we couldn't change it, although it may
end up becoming "file:" instead and having something that
distinguishes between mbox, maildir, and MH style folders.

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution 0.3.1 "Bandaged Jellyfish" is released

Hello,

        Bonobo (0.16), OAF (0.4), GNOME VFS (0.2), GConf (0.5),
        libunicode (0.4), GNOME Print (0.20) and ORBit (0.5.3).

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gtkhtml
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/bonobo

        Evolution users list by going to the Evolution home page on
        http://www.helixcode.com/apps/evolution.php3

Please note that this is still software in development and should not
be used for production work.  We appreciate testers and contributors,
but please remember that Evolution will still be buggy, incomplete,
and temperamental.

Thanks to the many people who have sent in suggestions and fixes.

(And of course, this announcement was sent with Evolution. :-))

Enjoy,
  The Evolution team.

How about changing the subscription to send the FAQ to every one who
Subscribes when they Subscribe, have a local Shaman curse it so that all
who fail to read it fail to gain posting rights to the list and a forced

Subject: [Evolution] FAQs and requests on the slashdot article

OK, I just scoured the /. posting about evolution 0.3.0,

and here are the FAQs not answered in the FAQ

1) How can I/will evolution allow me to, see headers?
2) How do I automatically install with debian/redhat/favorite distro?
3) Can I easily migrate my mailbox to/from client Mutt/Pine/etc.?
4) What is the install order for installing Gnome, Gnome Libs, and Evolution
by hand? (i.e. no helix update, debs, rpms, but all from source...)
5) Will I be able to access my mail via Xserver, a terminal etc.
6) What standard mail protocols are supported? (We only mention future
planned support, not what is supported - ie most of MAPI and POP3 ...)
7) What is Evolution?  (Answered in many other places, but not in the FAQ)
8) Where can I download it from? (Again answered in locations aside from the
FAQ)
9) Where can I find documents on how to hack it?

Okay, that's it for the FAQs

Now for frequent feature requests -
1) Interact with the proprietary servers (MS Exchange, Lotus Exchange...
etc.)
2) seemless/easy GnuPG, PGP support (which we got a patch for yesterday -
yay)
3) Remote access via terminal/xserver

Hope you all find this useful

 You forgot rpm -tb the rest of the tar.gz. In other
words, you need hours on my lowly machine to get that
up and running. Heck, it's way to much longer than a
fast download :)

Subject: [Evolution] v0.3.1 doesn't like my birthday (Date problem with contacts when saving
 changes via Icon)

Hello,

each time you save a contact via the save_icon, both birthday &
anniversary date
are 'decremented' by one day.

First, my birthday was 5/19/1977, i changed something else (Office
Field) and saved.
Reopening it, i saw 5/18/1977. Retrying it -> 5/17/1977.

Same thing with Anniversary field

Quite strange.

Accessory, the tooltip behind the save_icon is 'save the appointment and
close ...'


Bye

I've seen this before.  My guess is they are using the unix time stamp,
and are setting hours, mins, & seconds to 0, and the day doesn't actually
start till the 1st second.  There for it ends up subtracting 1 day when
you write the data.  At least that's what the problem was with my code
that did that same thing.

I just tried reproducing this and havent' been able to.  What OS and
distribution are you seeing this on?

That's what it does.  That's probably the most common thing someone will
want to do.

Hey there :) I'm new to the list, and at 0.3.1, I figured I'd be able to offer some constructive critisism. However, I can't seem to run Evolution. Here's the error:

Now, I installed everything in a very sane manner, and both tarballs(oh boy - that was a long compile) and RPMs give me the same error. I completely removed every trace of any installed file from the tarballs before I tried the RPMs(I captured the output of 'make install' for each package, and removed them by hand[more or less]).

This is a strange problem (bug?). It shouldn't be trying to load the 0.2
version of the vee module so I'm not sure what gives. What you could try
doing is a making a link from 0.2/libcamelvee.so.0 to
0.3/libcamelvee.so.0

Subject: [Evolution] configure does not find libxml?

Hi,

I am trying to build evolution-0.3.1, and the configure script seems 
to find all the important libraries until it gets to some xml check. 
There I get the error:

checking for xmlNewDoc in -lxml... no
configure: error: Could not link sample program

I know I have both libxml-1.8.9-1 and libxml-devel-1.8.9-1 installed. 
I even tried downloading, building, and installing libxml-1.8.7, but 
no luck there.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Ujwal

I sort my email by date, descending.

whatever the default sort order is for my inbox.

Doesn't maintain the sorting by date descending (arrow pointing up in
the date column.

And to my wishlist, I'd really love some text wrapping in the compose
screen.

I am using .30

In my experience text wrapping works when composing a new message, but
not when 
replying to a message. In the latter case the cursor gets to the end of
the line
and then when you keep typeing the cursor continues to go right, but no
text 
appears on the screen. If you then use the back arrow to get to the
point where 
words stopped appearing and press return, everything appears as typed on
the next 
line.

New configuration changes will require the re-entry of your evolution

The configuration bit will now store multiple identities and sources,

Yes.  When auto* tests for a function in a library, it builds a small
test program (which it links) to do this.  If the CFLAGS or LDFLAGS env
var have been set during th auto* script, they are involved in this. 
Probably another library is causing the problem.  Check config.log to
see if you can figure out what library is not being linked properly.

Hi,

Since evolution 0.2, I am getting this error message (dialog box) while trying to send mail via SMTP:

Could not send message:
HELO reponse error: Success: non-fatal

I did not have this problem with evolution 0.1. Unfortunately no information is printed to the console regarding this error. 

Hope someone can help.

I picked up the tar balls from the evolution announcement site and oaf doesn't compile.

It uses -Werror but uses pointer arithmetic in a number of files. I had to remove the -Werror to get it

 to compile. It also uses -Wpointer-arith.

I'm using gcc 2.95.2

I looked in the config.log file, and it said that it could not find 
the asound library (-lasound). I searched the web and found that 
libasound is provided by the alsa-lib package. However, when I 
installed that, I still got the same error. alsa-lib provides 
libasound.so and installs it in /usr/lib. Should I be installing some 
other package?

Thanks,

I've also had problems compiling bonobo 0.16, but my problem concerns the gdk-pixbuf. Here is the error I got trying to configure bonobo:

checking for GDK_PIXBUF - version >= 0.6.0... no
*** The gdk-pixbuf-config script installed by GDK_PIXBUF could not be found
*** If GDK_PIXBUF was installed in PREFIX, make sure PREFIX/bin is in
*** your path, or set the GDK_PIXBUF_CONFIG environment variable to the
*** full path to gdk-pixbuf-config.
configure: error: Need gdk-pixbuf!

This is strange because my version of gdk-pixbuf is 0.8 (helix), and I couldn't figure out how to fix this.

Try running evolution-mail in a separate xterm

first make sure to killev, after that run evolution-mail and wait a few
seconds and then start evolution in another xterm, this should allow
evolution-mail to print debug info to the console

Ok, 

I ran evolution-mail in another xterm before starting evolution and here is the output:

 evolution-mail: Yeeh! We have an owner!
 Decoding addresses -- smaclean@ns.sympatico.ca
 Decoding addresses --
 Decoding addresses --
 sending : EHLO 192.168.0.2
 received: 501 Invalid domain syntax

 camel-smtp-transport::connect(): provider does not use AUTH

At this point, I get the error dialog box stating:

 Could not send message:
 HELO response error: Success: non-fatal.

When I telnet to the smtp provider, here is what I get:

 220 jubilee.ns.sympatico.ca ESMTP server (Post.Office v3.5.2 release 221 ID# 0-66967U86000L86000S0V35 ready Sat, 29 Jul 2000 19:10:44 -0300

Typing EHLO 192.168.0.2 (I am behind a masqueraded box) in the telnet session produces the same "Invalid domain syntax" error.
Again, sending mail via SMTP in evolution 0.1 worked fine with this provider. 

Hope this helps.

Looks like the ESMTP provider doesn't like your IP/hostname :-)

It should still send your email though, that's why it says "non-fatal"

I'm not sure how to fix the problem other than just making it so the 
dialog doesn't pop up

If you're using Linux, then probably not, vi is a Unix command.

Right now only the gtkhtml editor is working, but in the future
other editors will be supported.

> Will I be able to use vi to compose messages if I use evolution?

We have no-one working on this at present, but it's relatively easy to
do.

The message composer just loads a Bonobo Control which is then embedded
as the editor; you can replace the default editor with a different one
as long as the replacement editor is a Bonobo Control. So one could
write a ZVT-based Bonobo Control that can embed an arbitrary
terminal-based editor, and then Evolution could use any arbitrary
terminal-based editor.

The integration would not be perfect GUI-wise, of course, but if people
really want to use VI for composing email, I guess that's the only way.

Volunteers? :-)

Or the GTK+ version of VIM's "gvim" could be bonobo-ized. I think this
would make a great control.

I'd be into it too BTW. Dunno if I'd have the time to do it myself, but
I'd certainly use it ;)

Just tried out evolution some, it looks great, very smooth :) I would choose it in a instant I knew how to get it to convert my current GnomeCard and GnomeCal files. This would also make it easy to sync with my palm pilot. Or, I guess finishing the pilot interfaces would work also. Any info on either items??

Hm. Yes, that's wrong. It should be "EHLO [192.162.0.2]". That should
be fixed. I guess your SMTP server is just pickier than most.

I like what exmh does: edit in vi, prompt for send/re-edit/re-edit in
mime-aware editor/various other options.  When you have a message with mime
in it, you first write the plain test part in vi, then quit vi and bring up
the other editor, which mimeifies it and lets you add attachments.  Best of
both worlds.

Do you have gdk-pixbuf-devel installed? If you can't type in
'gdk-pixbuf-config --help' at the prompt and get output, something
is messed up with your installation of gdk-pixbuf-devel --
try 'rpm -V gdk-pixbuf-devel'.

Hi there,

Thanks!

Subject: [Evolution] mail compose blank screen???

Hi All,
After unsuccessfully trying to launch Evolution preview 2, results below:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443
751d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

I have now downloaded Evolution preview 3 & the updated bits and pieces, all
install fine except evolution 3 will not ./configure for me!!, not on front
of the machine so don't know the error message now...

BUT, Evolution2 now launches!!!, it will retrieve my pop3 email, but when I
choose to reply or create a new message I am left with a grey screen, all
buttons disappear and I am left with no options except for quitting....

Any help on how to workaround this would be appreciated,
thanks, Dave.

I believe bonobo .16 is the latest version of it....they might have made a
mistake and meant .05 because on the helixcode site it says that evolution
.15 is required to compile. Just grab the latest one which is .16 and you'll
be fine

Well, generally yes .5 is > .15, but this is versioning, thus the . is just
a separator, not a decimal, so you should think of it a 15 and 5

Subject: [Evolution] Building Evolution w/o Pilot support

This may be a silly question, but can I build Evolution w/o support for
PalmPilot?

Since I don't have a PalmPilot, I installed Gnome w/o pilot-link, or
gnome-pilot.  When
I try to build, I get an error that libpisock cannot be found.  I went
ahead and installed
pilot-link and gnome-pilot, but evidently I need the latest versions
from CVS.  Since I
don't have a PalmPilot, I'd really rather not install CVS code for
something I cannot use
or test.

Are there any special tricks to building without pilot support?  Maybe a
parameter to
be passed along when building?

Thanks,

Hi there,

I have Evolution 2 running fine, from a RPM.
I wanted to look at E 3.0 but when I try to
compile it I get the following error.

checking whether to enable maintainer-specific
portions of Makefiles... no
checking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu
checking for gnome-config... no
checking for gnomeConf.sh file in
/usr/local/lib... not found
configure: error: Could not find the gnomeConf.sh
file that is generated by gnome-libs install

any Suggestions.

Thanks.
Jason.

I had the same problem. You have to compile gtkhtml-package against
bonobo and oaf.

That is, make sure that you have bonobo and oaf packages properly 
configured and installed and then recompile gtkhtml. It's not necessary
to recompile whole Evolution.

When are we going to have some keyboard shortcuts? Using that toolbar is
quite disturbing.

Do you have the gnome-libs-devel package installed?  You need it.
The *-devel packages have *-config, *Conf.sh, header files, etc.

Subject: [Evolution] Building Evolution w/o Pilot support


This may be a silly question, but can I build Evolution w/o support for
PalmPilot?

Since I don't have a PalmPilot, I installed Gnome w/o pilot-link, or
gnome-pilot.  When
I try to build, I get an error that libpisock cannot be found.  I went
ahead and installed
pilot-link and gnome-pilot, but evidently I need the latest versions
from CVS.  Since I
don't have a PalmPilot, I'd really rather not install CVS code for
something I cannot use
or test.

Are there any special tricks to building without pilot support?  Maybe a
parameter to
be passed along when building?

Thanks,

Raymond S. Swaim

In addition, you will need to configure evolution like this:
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
otherwise you need to set GNOME_PATH and ACLOCAL_FLAGS, etc.
(or alternatively, you can build gnome-libs from source, and then install
evolution and its dependencies into the same prefix you installed
gnome-libs into).
Read the evolution/README file for more details.

  Hi there,
  I have Evolution 2 running fine, from a RPM. I wanted to look at E 3.0 but
when I try to compile it I get the following error.

  checking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... no

The configure script should only try to find libpisock if it finds the
gnome-pilot package. You're sure you don't have it installed? What
does the configure output say in the lines before the error? What does
"gnome-config --modversion gpilot" say?

It crashes. This bug has already been fixed in CVS. Until 0.4, just
"don't do that, then" :-}. (Or you can create an empty mbox file in
each dir: "touch ~/evolution/local/Drafts/mbox", etc.)

The GConf libraries should probably be included as well on the Evolution

not, but its certainly required by other packages.

Hi.. I am attempting to compile Evolution .3 and have run into a problem in

and when it looks for xmlNewDoc it tells me

cannot link sample xml program...

is there something i am missing....i have all the required libraries (i

I am also having this problem.  I'm not sure that our problems are exactly
related, but here are the last few lines in the config.log file where it
fails:

configure:6558: checking for xmlNewDoc in -lxml
configure:6577: gcc -o conftest -g -O2 -Wall -Wunused  -I/usr/include
-DNEED_GNO
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lasound
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
configure: failed program was:
#line 6566 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char xmlNewDoc();

int main() {
xmlNewDoc()
; return 0; }

As you can see it can't find libasound.a or libasound.so (I think)  I have
looked around and don't seem to have them, nor do I know where to get it.
supposedly from RPMfind, the alsaplayer package contains it, but it doesn't
appear to to me... I still have the same problem after I install it anyway...
I can't for the life of me figure out how -lasound is getting into the script,
so I can't even take it out.  Oh well, I hope that helps you.  I know I am
stuck though...

Subject: [Evolution] Quick tool to import a directory of mbox-style files

--XsQoSWH+UP9D9v3l
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I wanted to import my old ~/Mail directory with 15+ years of stored mail
into Evolution (a nice stress-test), so I came up with this quick and
dirty hack to mass-import a directory of mbox-style files and subdirectories
into the specified Evolution folder.  I'm sending it here in case it might
be useful to other Evolution users.

Useage: mbox-import /path/to/evolution/local/foldername.  It reads all
files and subdirectories, and copies them into the specified folder.  It
descends into subdirectories and does the Right Thing (I hope).  Each
mbox file is created as a subfolder of the specified folder, with 
subdirectories created as sub-subfolders.

Caveats: Only been tested with mbox-style folders.  Will copy any file,
regardless of whether it's an mbox folder.  Copies, not moves.  Shouldn't
touch the original files.  Only tested on my machines (RH6.2, Solaris 7).
YMMV. 

ja.

I had the same problem. It turned out the sample program tries to link
against libasound that I did not have. I had to the alsa-lib and
alsa-lib-devel rpms.

I had libxml 1.8.9 installed.  I reverted back to 1.8.7 (the only way I
found to do this was to get the 1.8.7 rpms and install them with a
--nodeps and a --force flag.)  "rpm -a -q | grep libxml" now claims that
1.8.7 is installed, but I still get the same errors, again failing to
link with the -lasound flag. (see previous messages in thread for more
detail.) So really, I still don't have much of an idea of what is going
on.   :>

Subject: [Evolution] Filters are gone :(

I spent like an hour doing filters for evolution (I was planning
on trying it as my work email client and I need about 20 filters)
the other day.  But I didn't quite get done with the filters and
I wasn't going to use it yet, so I just closed it.  Well today I
open it, go to Filter Druid to finish the filters, and NONE of my
filters are there anymore!  Can I get them back? Do I just have
to reload a config file?  Or do the filters no longer get saved? 
Thanks!

Misty

PS - I'm running the newest pre-release (not CVS) on RedHat 6.2
updated to the 2.2.16 kernel, on a Celeron 500.  Thanks!

Yes, I got evolution to compile and run, but I still hadproblems. Whenever I
hit the reply button, evolution seemed to hang. I had the libxml 1.8.9
package. I removed it and installed 1.8.7 to see if that works better. It
did. The "Reply" button now works. I removed the libxml and libxml-devel
rpms using rpm -e --nodeps, and compiled and installed the 1.8.7 from the
tarball.

Hmm...Strange....Downgrading to run a package...This will be a problem in a
future with other programs...I hope the evolution team gets ontop of this
problem.

i'll try 1.8.7 to be sure myself that it will actually compile.

Yes, I got evolution to compile and run, but I still hadproblems. Whenever I
hit the reply button, evolution seemed to hang. I had the libxml 1.8.9
package. I removed it and installed 1.8.7 to see if that works better. It
did. The "Reply" button now works. I removed the libxml and libxml-devel
rpms using rpm -e --nodeps, and compiled and installed the 1.8.7 from the
tarball.

Subject: [Evolution] Re-receiving email

I have been using evolution 0.3.1 for my email client for the last day,
and I have noticed that when I receive my mail from the server it works
find, then if I hit Get mail again before there is any new mail, the
last message received from the server in the last Get mail is received
again.  This happens until new mail arrives, then starts again with the
last message from the new mail batch.  I am receiving my mail over pop,
if this helps.

The other thing I noticed, is when your composing a message, if your
cursor is on a line and you hit end, you goto the end of your message,
not the the end of the line, I'm not sure how this is suppost to react
but seems a bit strange when the cursor jumps to the end of your
signature and you have to figure out where you are, the same with home
going to row one char one of the email.

I'm not sure that's a good idea because Evolution adds it's own headers
(X-Evolution) to the header when you use it's import feature, copying the
files to the evolution directory may work but there may be problems

Dan, any comments?

None of the current preview releases of Evolution support multiple accounts,
there is some beginnings of support for that in current CVS HEAD, but it's
still a bit buggy.

Hi Dan,

Is this an old requirement? I have libxml 1.8.9 installed and I can
compile CVS as well as the 0.3.1 tarballs. Am I just lucky? :-)

libxml-1.8.9-0_helix_1
libxml-devel-1.8.9-0_helix_1

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

That's kind of a bummer. Do you know if it's currently even being worked
on?  Cuz I think it would be much easier to try and use Evolution and try
to debug, etc. if I knew that at least the work I was doing had a chance
of being saved.  Whatcha think?

Thanks!

Well, I could compile too, but the "Reply" button wouldn't work. When I went
to libxml 1.8.7, it worked. Coincidence?

Isn't there a way to do it with filters?  You can do on each
outgoing message, copy it to Sent.  

Of course, nobody ever got back with me about why my filters
weren't saved....

What's wrong with it. Does it have anything to do with gnome-pilot or

Are you running Mandrake 6/7? Their gcc is buggy and breaks with a lot
of packages. Try switching to Red Hat's gcc. I'm running Mandrake 6.1
with the Red Hat 6.0 gcc.

Subject: [Evolution] filter happiness and sadness

The good news: the filter "to" rule is now a "to or cc" rule.

The bad news: I fixed a spelling mistake at the same time, thus
breaking existing filters and vfolders. If you have filters or
vfolders defined, you need to change all occurrences of "receipient"
to "recipient" to make them work again after you next "make install"
in evolution/filter.

Eg:

M-x replace-string [RET]
receipient [RET]
recipient [RET]

Have a nice day.

So I take it CVS snaps have the ability to actually respond/create mail?  I
ask because the 0.1 version I installed does not have that ability.

Subject: [Evolution] preferred language

Hi !

There should be an entry in the contact list for the "preferred language": this
would enable an application which would access the contact list to retrieve an
email address to send automatically the email in the right language.
Explanation: I have in mind an application which should automatically send a
mail to some of your contacts, and being able to know which language to use is a
definite plus. So there should be a hook te retrieve this.

Yeah, eventually we'll want to have to-only and cc-only rules, but for
now, people are mostly using this for "put mail to this mailing list
in this folder", so we pretty much all wanted to-or-cc all the time.

0.1 does have the ability to send mail actually. Even 0.0 did. If you
can't send mail, then you probably have some sort of
compile/installation problem.

Subject: [Evolution] Looking good, but a mail question

OK, so I just spent a few hours downloading and compiling Evolution and
related utilities from CVS on a woody system, and it's looking pretty
slick compared to 0.0 (the last version I tried). However, I have a
question.

I chose to import my ~/mbox file, which was in and of itself pretty
stupid, since I know it's not all stable yet. However, what i didn't
realize was that, upon checking my mail, it would remove all mail from
~/mbox. OK, I'll just copy the mailbox Evolution creates back to ~/,
right? Well, the mbox file Evolution made looks normal, but neither mutt
nor mailx can load it. So I'm a bit stuck. Is there a way to make this a
standard mbox file again, short of forwarding myself all the mail? Also,
shouldn't be there a way to prevent the clearing behaviour in the first
place? Not that I don't mind using Evolution to read my old mail, but
I'm a bit wary of using a pre-alpha program for that.

Oh yes, and apologies if this message comes across odd-looking, it's my
first attempt at sending mail with Evo.

It is a standard mbox.  Some mailers are just particular about what
they think is standard (i.e. there is no standard?).

You just have to make the From lines (any line beggining
with exactly "From " in the mailbox) be something like

From user@host.domain Thu Jul  8 22:30:12 2000

Rather than the From - that evolution uses.

Yes, you point it at a copy of your mailbox, not the real one. :)

Evolution incorporates mail so it can index and filter and control
access to its mailboxes better.

Something like the following might help:

formail -i "From " -s formail <mbox >mbox.new

The -i "From " thing makes it remove the "From " line and
sending it through formail again makes it add in another one
based on other headers.

The same thing happens when I try to open the Outbox or Trash.

Also, when I choose "Mail Configuration" under Tools, the evolution-mail =

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution 0.2 "Saccharomyces" is released

Dear lifeforms,

Our tireless team of dancing primates has assembled version 0.2 of the
Evolution groupware suite (codename "Saccharomyces").

Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, and addressbook application.
This release incorporates many new features and bug fixes since the 
previous version.

* Availability:

  You can get the Evolution 0.2 tarball here:

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/evolution

  Evolution also requires a new version of GtkHTML (0.5), Bonobo
  (0.15), GNOME Print (0.20), OAF (0.5) and ORBit (0.5.2).  These
  packages are available from:

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources

* Changes in this version:

        Shell:
        
          * Folder selection dialog (Ettore).
        
          * Folder creation dialog (Ettore).
        
        Addressbook:
        
          * LDAP server configuration dialog (Chris Toshok).
          
          * Integration of LDAP servers in the shell's tree view
            (Chris Toshok).
          
          * ETable-based view (Chris Lahey).
          
          * Printing support for the ETable-based view (Chris Lahey).
          
          * Address selection dialog integrated with the message
            composer (Chris Lahey).
          
          * Many miscellaneous bugs fixed (everyone).
        
        
        Calendar:
        
          * Printing support (Michael, Federico).
          
          * Many, many behavior fixes and polishing to the
            day/week/month view widgets (Damon).
          
          * New glade-based event editor.  This is unfinished but
            usable (Seth, Federico).
          
          * Mouse wheel scrolling support (Anders).
          
          * We have an awesome new engine for computing recurring
            events (Damon).  This will be plugged in to the new
            iCalendar code.
          
          * Internal and public API fixes (Federico, Seth).
          
          * Shell-related changes (Ettore).
          
          * Data model for ETable; this is not used yet (Federico).
          
          * New iCalendar support; this is not used yet (Federico).
          
          * Pilot syncing updates; this is not used yet (Seth).
          
          * Many miscellaneous bugs fixed (everyone).
        
        Mailer:
        
          Major features:
        
          * Basic IMAP support (Jeff)
        
          * Threaded message view (Michael, Chris Toshok)
        
          * Filters now work (original work by Michael, bugfixes by
            Dan)
        
          Smaller features:
        
          * Implemented moving messages between folders (Dan)
        
          * Very basic printing support (Dan, but it was only like 5
            lines of code, because gnome-print kicks ass)
        
          * "Delete", "Forward", and "Refile" operations now work on
            multiple messages. (Chris Lahey, Peter Williams, Dan)
        
          * Toggle read/unread flag when the user clicks on the
            envelope icon (Chris Lahey, Dan).
        
          * The "New folder" menu item now works (Ettore, Dan).
        
          * The filter/vfolder druid now uses the new shell folder
            selection UI (Michael)
        
          * Added "Cc" to the set of filter/vfolderable headers and
            make the filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule work
            with to or cc.  (Dan)
        
          * New key bindings: "Delete" deletes the current message and
            jumps to the next undeleted message. "N" and "P" go to
            next/previous unread message. (Dan)
        
          * Keep asking for POP/IMAP password until the user gets it
            correct or hits Cancel, and remember the result until the
            user exits (or chooses "Forget Passwords"). (Dan, Jeff)
        
          * Kludge Camel to output ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, since
            neither GtkHTML nor ETable supports UTF-8 still. (Dan)
        
          * Use the gnome-vfs "sniff buffer" interface to try to
            identify the MIME type of attachments without useful type
            information (Dan)
        
          * Allow saving drafts in the composer (Ettore)
        
          * Added "Received date" header to the set of possible
            message list headers. (Dan)
        
          * Partial gladification of the config dialog (JP Rosevear)
        
          Bug fixes:
        
          * Message read/unread/deleted flags should now be saved
            reliably when you exit, and summary should not be rebuilt
            when a rebuild isn't needed. Expunging should work
            reliably (Dan, Ettore, Jeff).
        
          * Fix disappearing toolbar bug (Dan).
        
          * Fixed a bug that made downloading of very large messages
            over POP incredibly slow, and various other smaller POP
            bugs. (Dan)
        
          * Fixed bugs that made large attachments sometimes get
            dropped and small ones sometimes get truncated. (Dan)
        
          * Fixed filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule to
            correctly match "to" rather than "from". (Michael)
        
          * Fix some text/plain formatting bugs in the composer. (Dan,
            Ettore)
        
          * Turn off search mode when getting new mail (to avoid
            corrupting the display). Make "get mail" always put
            unfiltered mail into Inbox rather than the current
            folder. (Dan)
        
          * Fixed a bug that caused "Re:" to be prepended even to
            subjects that started with "Re:" when replying. Added a
            default subject to forwarded messages. (Dan)
        
          * Make the "Attach" dialog in the composer remember the last
            directory it was in. (Dan)
        
          * Code to parse invalid date formats since some mailers
            generate them... (Jeff)
        
          * Fixed various small SMTP bugs (Jeff, Chris Lahey)
        
          * Fixed some memory leaks (Peter, Jeff)
        
          * Make replies use the text/plain part of a
            multipart/alternative if the user configured plain text
            rather than HTML mail sending.  (Dan)
        
          * Various config dialog fixes (Jeff)
        
          * Partial filter/vfolder GUI facelift (Jacob)

Please note that this is still software in development and should not
be used for production work.  We appreciate testers and contributors;
you'll be in our hearts forever, but please remember that Evolution
will still be buggy, incomplete, and temperamental.

Thanks to the many people who have sent in suggestions and fixes.

(And of course, this announcement was sent with Evolution. :-))

Enjoy,

  The Evolution team

Subject: [Evolution] problem w/ gnome-vfs 0.2

    Hi all, I'm sorry if this is inappropriate for this group, but I
think I have everything working to compile evolution but gnome-vfs 0.2
I've tried both an ftp.gnome.org tarball and a cvs update and neither
will compile.  Here's the problem w/ the tarball:

 gcc -g -O2 -Wall -Wunused -Wall -Wno-uninitialized -Wchar-subscripts

any ideas on what to do?  I'm using oaf-0.3 b/c oaf-0.4 won't compile
with my ORBit 0.5.1.   I'm excited to get this working, but I'm not
quite sure what's wrong.  Thanks in advance,

You need the latest OAF and the latest ORBit (from the stable 0.5.x 
branch) - I think the latest is 0.5.2

If you can not compile ORBit, then that is your problem (but you have 
provided no info on that compile error so we can not help).

Regards,
Ali

gconf-client.o(.text+0xb97): undefined reference to `gconf_listeners_new'
gconf-client.o(.text+0xbc4): undefined reference to `gconf_listeners_add'

I fixed this by swapping the -lgconf and -lgconf-gtk, as they were in the
wrong order.

Hi all !
Just trying to compile the packages I need to get Evolution running,
and
I've been halted at oaf.
When running 'make' I eventually get this:

Paul,

Looks like you need to install yacc (in /usr/bin on my Redhat 6.1 box).
Don't know which package this is part of, since the Redhat installer
does all that for me.

$ rpm -qf /usr/bin/yacc
byacc-1.9-12

Although why it isn't using bison instead is beyond me (i suspect
it can use either, but dont quote me on that).

Hi there,

I have been trying in vane to compile both evolution 0.1 and now also
0.2

If anyone could offer some advice/suggestions I would greatly
appreciate it!!

e-shell.h:32: gconf/gconf-client.h: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [e-component-registry.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/kschar/gnome/evolution-0.2/shell'

make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/kschar/gnome/evolution-0.2/shell'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/kschar/gnome/evolution-0.2'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

I always seem to receive these type of errors and I don't now that much about compiling "YET" but if someone could help me figure this out I would be grateful! Thanks!
 
  Ken

P.S. If you need more info please let me know - I'll be glad to provide it!

Looks like you need the gconf package as well.

Ok, so I have ORBit-0.5.2, but oaf-0.4 won't build, here's my error with
this.  How do I turn this error back into an error and not a warning that
makes the compiler exit?  Thanks again

Subject: [Evolution] GConf install errors

Hi there,

Trying to get evolution to compile let me to find out that I needed to
install GConf.  Soooo - I configured & made GConf with no errors however
when I try to do a make install I receive the following error.

Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!
  Ken

It means xmlParseFile("./desktop.schemas") returned a document with no
root node.  I have no idea why it would do that. :-(

Subject: [Evolution] gconf install problems

Hello,

I am trying to install the gconf cvs packages and am running into the
following error when I execute the ./autogen.sh script.  I'm not sure if
I'm doing something wrong or not, any help would be appreciated.

I have installed all the packages off of the Evolution webpage except
for Evolution itself as gconf seems to be required to do so.

The output follows:

[root@loki gconf]# ./autogen.sh
I am going to run ./configure with no arguments - if you wish
to pass any to it, please specify them on the ./autogen.sh command line.

Subject: [Evolution] Indication of unread messages

The latest version of Evolution is excellent; well done!  It's very
close to the stage where I'd consider it as my default mail reader.

But one facility which I consider essential is some form of indication
of the number of unread mail items in a folder - or even just an
indication that there is unread mail in a folder. Is this planned?

Yup. It nearly made it into 0.2... it may be working in the CVS
versions within the next week. (We're all annoyed by the lack of that
feature too... with lots of filters, it turns into a game to find
where your mail ended up when when you fetch it :)

Subject: [Evolution] turning error warnings into ignored warnings?

Sometimes I can't compile something because all of the warnings are treated as
errors and it exits. I want the warnings to be treated as regular warnings and
not errors. This is what I usually get:

cc1: warnings being treated as errors

I know theres is a configure option for this, I just don't know what it is.

I've gotten this with gnome-vfs in the past but I can't remember how I solved
it.
Now I've actually gotten to the point where I want to compile Evolution or
Nautilus. But it treats all my warnings as errors.

Thanks,
Tony

If you configure gnome-vfs (or oaf) with "--disable-more-warnings", it
won't do that.

As far as I know, gnome-vfs and oaf are the only package Evolution
depends on that behaves that way.

You should make sure that the things it's complaining about aren't
caused by you trying to build them against the wrong versions of their
prerequisite libraries though.

Subject: [Evolution] Problems with bonobo and evolution

Hi !

I've problems to compile evolution 0.2. After installing all required
packages including bonobo 0.15 i tried to install evolution.

But at the ./configure I get the following message. :

--- snip ---

checking for Bonobo >= 0.15... configure: error: Bonobo 0.15 is required
to compile Evolution

--- snip ---

My system is Red Hat 6.2 and the most recend version of helix gnome.

Hello,

I had that problem earlier, when I recompiled everything and specified the
--prefix and --sysconfdir directives to ./configure, setting them
appropriatly the problem went away.  I was using ./configure --prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc

Most of the packages needed those flags set so evolution could find them

Hope this helps

Dan

Ok, so I got some help from fejj on irg.gnome.org in #evolution and he suggested that I set ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/share/aclocal"

but then when running sh autogen.sh I got the errors in bonoboerrout (attached)

so he suggested i get oaf, whose readme says that you have to have the latest orbit. so I got the latest orbit and

trying the sh autogen.sh there, I got the errors in errout (attached).

I really want to help, but I can't get anything to compile. I have gcc 2.95.2 and I have the latest helix gnome stuff.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what's wrong?

I also picked up the src of gnome-libs and ompiled them, and that went fine. But it didn't help anything else...

thank you in advance!

This suggestion is a shot in the dark, but it's easy to try. :-)

My theory:

The various Gnome RPMs are installed under /usr , but the default when
you run configure (or autogen.sh, which runs configure for you) is to
put things under /usr/local .  So Bonobo, ORBit, etc., are going to wind
up installing under /usr/local and (I assume) looking for support files
there as well.

So, try running autogen.sh --prefix=/usr instead of just autogen.sh;
this should cause all the code you're compiling to install under /usr
and look for support files there.

Best of luck,

Nathan

Subject: [Evolution] Crash on startup with OAFD error

Hello,

I am trying to run Evolution 0.2 on a Linux Mandrake 7.1 system,
building RPMs of all the packages apart from GConf (no spec file). After
installing everything I tried running evolution, and this error message
came up:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b.
(Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

I set OAF_INFO_PATH to /usr/share/oaf; if OAF_INFO_PATH is not set the
only difference is that 'trying /usr/share/oaf/' appears before the
warning.

Any help appreciated,

Michel

Have a look at /tmp/orbit-XXXXX where XXXXX is your username. Deleting it
should work because it seems that once you have started the program with a
wrong OAF_INFO_PATH, it keeps the configuration there. 

In my case, deleting the full /tmp/orbit-ctalon, and setting the OAF_INFO_
PATH to /usr/share/oaf worked ok, although I had to start evolution a couple of
times again in order to have the menus working.

BTW, this is on a debian dist, but I don't thing there should be differences
there.

No thats not quite correct during the autoconf stage (it is when
compiling), aclocal looks for macros in the default place where
it was installed, which is /usr/share/aclocal, and that is the
problem it is having.

I think he's missing the libtool macros, which probably means
he's missing (or maybe out of date) libtool (or alternatively,
auto* can't find it), try searching for libtool.m4, that is
where that macro is defined.

Phooey.  I thought that might not pan out.   Thanks for correcting me.

Subject: [Evolution] RPMs ?

Hi all,

First of all, I'd like to thank HelixCode for the whole great work
that's being done around Gnome. It will definitly help Linux penetrate
the end/windows user public.

I also was wondering if s.o. had been kind enough to build rpms of
evolution 0.2 and needed librairies.

Thx.

I have some problem with compilation.

I have latest helixcode gnome
I fetch evolution packages from gnome.labs.redhat.com
and try compilation it and instalation.
-------------------------------------------
cd /var/tmp/

cd ../oaf-0.4.0/
./configure --prefix=/usr

IN ./configure --prefix=/usr I received this warning: But when I tried set
GCONF_CONFIG, nothing was changed.

Subject: [Evolution] compiling evolution

Hi,

when i try to compile evolution i get this error message:

main.o: In function `main':
/tmp/evolution-0.2/mail/main.c:79: undefined reference to `gconf_init'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [evolution-mail] Error 1

make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/evolution-0.2'

it's weird, 'cause as far as i know it can find the gconf.h where
gconf_init is initialized. 
any ideas?

Hanne

I have installed all the required packages and they all compiled without 
any trouble, i'm not very experienced with compiling but I would really 
like to get this working... I hate evolution 0.1 working but no luck 
with this release.
Any pointers would be appreciated

Thanks in advance

Kyle

 Download Gconf 0.5. It is a must even though not given on helix's site.

 And, yes it is ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/unstable/sources/GConf/

Subject: [Evolution] Can't send mail and buttons disappear.

I have Evolution 0.2 installed fine however when I try to reply or 
compose mail the main window goes blank and all the buttons in the 
button bar disappear.  Anyone have any ideas?  

I also had the old 
problem of looking at something in the address book or calendar 
(can't remember) and then not being able to open the Inbox again 
because "A view already exists".

The only thing I didn't compile was bonobo-0.15 because I already 
had that from the 0.1 try at Evolution.

Very nice work by the way.

You can also set the ACLOCAL_FLAGS variable to additional paths, ie:

ACLOCAL_FLAGS=-I /opt/gnome/share/aclocal

I do this in /etc/profile or you could do it in your local shell setup.

Hi 

great product, btw ;-)

Evolution v0.2 (d/l it from cvs 4 h ago)

My system: i586-pc-linux-gnu
latest helix rpms
bonobo 0.15
gnome-print 0.20
gnome-vfs 0.2
gtkhtml 0.5
libunicode 0.4
oaf 0.4.0

If you click on Tools -> Mail configuration -> Sources -> select an
existing pop3 account -> Edit, then mail source type is set to IMAPv4

If you then change to POP3, username and server fields are resetted,
this behaviour should be changed (in my opinion :-))

Perhaps you could also add an Option on the "New Message" window to
change from HTML mails to plain text mails.

If i enable vfolders and click on outbox/drafts/trash, i get a message:
Unable to get folder filer:///home/wingman/evolution/local/Drafts:
Folder '/mbox' does not exist. If i create e.g. file
/home/wingman/evolution/local/Drafts/mbox i get no error.

Next thing, perhaps you could change the behaviour of the "End" key in
new mails. If i press it, the cursor jumps down to the end of the mail
and not to the end of the line. 

I also got some segfaults, if i close evolution, but i couldnt
reproduce it. (Shouldnt there be any core files in my home?)

Ok, thats all for now :-)

Yes, the defaults go missing when you go back to the configuration - the
information should still be saved and work though.  This will be fixed
shortly.

I had a similar problem. I think that the spec file for generating RPM is the
cause of this problem because no oainfo files where copied into /usr/share/oaf
for me.

So i made a manual copy of
./mail/evolution-mail.oafinfo
./addressbook/gui/component/addressbook.oafinfo
./addressbook/gui/component/select-names/evolution-addressbook-select-names.oafinfo
./calendar/gui/calendar-control.oafinfo
./calendar/gui/evolution-calendar.oafinfo
./wombat/wombat.oafinfo

and now i can launch evolution but i have a crash when i try to access my
inbox
"Unable to get folder file://home/light/evolution/local/Inbox: No store
available for protocol 'mbox'"

Any help appreciated,
Jean-Michel

Hi there,

I "thought" I had now met all the reqs to compile evolution properly but

This is the latest error - any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

Get gconf-0.5 from ftp.gnome.org and install.  That ought to take care of
it.

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, I've already done that but I'm
still receiving the errors :-(   The same errors.

I also noticed this when running ./configure --prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc

checking for gnome-config... (cached) /usr/bin/gnome-config
checking for xmlNewDoc in -lxml... (cached) yes
checking if Bonobo uses OAF... yes
checking for oaf-config... (cached) /usr/bin/oaf-config
checking for gconf-config... (cached) no
checking for GCONF - version >= 0.5.0... no
*** The gconf-config script installed by GCONF could not be found
*** If GCONF was installed in PREFIX, make sure PREFIX/bin is in
*** your path, or set the GCONF_CONFIG environment variable to the
*** full path to gconf-config.

However, I've tried adding this to the path with no success.

Any other suggestions/tips that your willing to offer would be gratefully
received :-)

Thanks!
  Ken

did you install gconf in /usr ??
maybe it's installed in /usr/local
install gconf with --prefix=/usr

Hi Ken,

This may be the culprit:
checking for gconf-config... (cached) no
                              ^^^^^^

The fact that gconf-config is not found appears to cached (in
config.cache), so, rm config.cache, and rerun ./configure.

config.cache is created by configure script when it runs, if it doesn't
exist.  Next time you run configure, it uses cached data.  So, remove it,
that will force it to re-create the config.cache file, and (hopefully),
find gconf-config.  Also, make sure that gconf-config is in the $PATH of
the shell that executes configure.

Good luck,

-Mark

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution 0.2 RPMs

Hello,

There are now Evolution 0.2 RPMS available for Red Hat Linux.


They can be installed via helix-update.  When presented with the
mirror list, choose the "Evolution Preview" mirror.

There are two updates available: one containing the packages needed to
run evolution, and one containing the development packages needed to
compile the evolution tarball.


Alternatively, you can manually download the packages from:
ftp://ftp.helixcode.com/helix/evolution/distributions/RedHat-6/

or rebuild the SRPMS from:
ftp://ftp.helixcode.com/helix/evolution/distributions/RedHat-6/SRPMS/


We will be updating these when there new releases of Evolution are
made.

As always, please keep in mind that Evolution is in development and
will lose your mail.

Thanks,
Jacob & Ettore

Hello!

  I  don't  know  better  email  address for  getting  help  about  my
problem running evolution (0.2).
  - I've read the README
  - I've got helix gnome (debian packages)
  - I've installed all the remaining packages (into /opt/evolution)
  - I copied /opt/evolution/lib/*.sh /usr/lib
  - I     set    GNOME_PATH     (to    /usr),     OAF_INFO_PATH    (to
  /opt/evolution/share/oaf)

  The  Problem:  evolution  compiles,  but  when I  want  to  run,  it
crashes.

Gdk-WARNING **: shmget failed!

evolution-shell-WARNING    **:    Could   not    activate    component
evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail.  (Maybe  you   need  to  set
OAF_INFO_PATH?)

It seems to be an oaf problem.

Could you help  me solving this problem or forwarding to  this mail to
the proper person or mailing list?

Regards,

dLux

I would suggest the 'shmget()' failed is a clue.  Does the
system have SysV IPC support in the kernel?  Not sure which
comnponent uses it, whether its orbit, or oaf, etc.

Well, I have done all of the suggestions I've read so far, but I still get the OAF error, as well as a camel-ERROR.  I have set the OAF_INFO_PATH to /usr/share/oaf, copied over all the files, and I even deleted the /tmp/orbit-xxxx files.  No luck!  Any help would be appreciated.

camel-ERROR **: Could not open camel provider directory: No such file or directory

Hey, would you consider putting up a Nautilus-test mirror one of these days?
It's really hard to compile and keep up with all the sources, being so many. 
And thanks a lot for the Evolution 0.2 one =)

One more question.. Whatcha know about GNOME 1.4 or a 2.0beta1 version?

Alas, it does not work for me. I deleted all the files in /tmp/orbit-michel that
contained 'oaf' or 'OAF' in their names, and killed any active oafd - did not work.
So I proceeded to repeat again, this time removing the entire /tmp/orbit-michel;
did not make any different. Still the same error message...

Does OAF need to be compiled with any specific flags?

Thanks,

Michel

 Did you compile it as all other packages with the same --prefix and 
--sysconfdir as the rest of your gnome packages?

 You can obtain those by doing:
 gnome-config --prefix
 gnome-config --sysconfdir

 Thanks a lot. I could compile it, but prefer rpms anytime. Easier to 
track dependencies and such. The usual hype in other words ;)

 Anyway, I agree with the other poster, adding Nautilus would be a great 
idea.

 Maybe I should forward this to nautilus-list? I'll do it.

I suspect this is a sign of a deeper problem, but you will probably find 
that when make gets to to 'mail' it fails to include ``-lgconf -gconf-gtk''
in the list of libs... 

I hacked around this by correcting the make file, but evol segv's for me
due to gnome-split-install-fuckage.  I'm not sure if you will have this 
problem as well, but you can find out by editing the mail/Makefile and 
added the libs.

Subject: [Evolution] Gnome Print CVS status.

Hello guys,

   We might have not communicated this previously, but people are
running into problems because they are using gnome-print from CVS
HEAD.

   Lauris and I will be working on cleaning up massively gnome-print
in the next few weeks: we expect major API changes to be done in this
time.  Binary and source incompatible changes are being made to the
code right now in the HEAD branch. 

   If you need gnome-print, the official position right now is "use
the released tarball" until further notice.

   We do not have an estimate yet on when those changes will start to
stabilize, but we will try to keep people informed as the new code
base matures.

Best wishes,
Miguel.

Looks like you either (a) didn't build gtkhtml with bonobo support, or
(b) didn't build gtkhtml with oaf support. Either one would imply that
either you built the packages "out of order" (see Evolution's README
for an order that should work), or you installed something into a
non-default prefix and then didn't set GNOME_PATH when configuring the
later bits.

That means that at run time the mailer can't find the shared libraries
in the directory that it thinks you installed into (and thus won't
run, thus causing the shell error you also quoted, which is suggesting
that maybe you have an oaf problem, but it's wrong). Did you do
something weird with changing prefixes between configure time and
install time?

Thinking about this, I realized that all of the other packages installed into /usr, and evolution installed into /usr/local.  So I did a 'make uninstall' and then reinstalled with 'make install PREFIX=/usr' .  I no longer receive the camel error, but I still get the OAF error:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

Any other ideas?  OAF seemed to compile and install correctly.

I have a really good suggestion which I am actually stealing from Owen 
Taylor and his 'pango' project :)

Create RPMs using a different name than the standard i.e. gnome-vfs-ev, 
bonobo-ev, etc.

Also make sure they do not install in /usr (perhaps they should install 
in a /evolution directory or something). That way this will not 'clobber' 
different installations just for trying to play with Evolution (for 
example, I am hacking on gnome-vfs, I don't want to install a gnome-vfs 
RPM that will screw up my hacking/testing).

People may also need to run different RPMs for different packages.

Anyway - the way pango does it is install 'gtk+-gtkss' into /opt/pango or 
something like that. That way it does not clobber the Gtk+ RPM and it 
does not install files where they will get in the way.

Regards,
Ali

Hey - Thanks. 

I really want to keep up with the play on Evolution, do a little
testing, mail scren shots to my Windows buddies etc.  I habe Evolution 0
and 0.1, and even went as far as downloading the source...  But I am
into the idea of rpm's at the moment having recently rebuilt my entire
system.

   GNOME_PRINT_0_20 is the latest tag.

All good and well, except that 0.20 has a serious bug affecting
people who distribute precompiled packages: fonts are searched
for at configure time, not install time.

I've been trying to get these packages as described, however, when I try to I
get the following error:

Unable to download a list of updates

Is the server working?  Or do I have something misconfigured?  Thanks

Subject: [Evolution] No Tools Menu in Evolution 0.2

Hi there,

I just installed Evolution Preview 0.2 rpms and noticed that there is no
tools menu nor is there an actions menu (though I am not quite sure
wether the last is supposed to be there).

I already observed that when compiling evolution from source the last
few times, but always assumed its related to my screwed up system. The
start up log from evolution, which is attached below shows three
bonobo-criticals which - I think - might cause the problem.

Any help would be apriciated. Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Try to define a mail account, and then restart Evolution. The menus should be
now there.

That does not work at all. Did you do anything special (like deleting 
~/evolution)?

When we start doing Nautilus releases, we'll definitely be doing packages
(RPMs), and not just source tarballs. But we haven't done our first Nautilus
release yet.

 I know there is no nautilus release yet, but it would
be a good idea in my humble opinion to do preview
releases a la Helix Code's evolution.

 It's like evolution is really usable yet anyway, but
it might help you have some user feedback as to where
to head in terms of features and such.

 For evolution, I am "compiling" a list of things I
don't like and others I like.

 And anything would probably be better than current
gmc. Heck, I hate those $HOME/.gnome-desktop/.....
cache stuff that appears even when you open trashcan.
Stupid things like dragging a file to desktop to
create links is non existant, but instead you need to
fill in full path of the damned destination.

 Anyway, I'll stop whining about gmc, but promise to
be there for its official burial ceremony.

Binary RPMs rock. I tried downloading source tarballs and while with
worked for me for the 0.1 release, doing the same with the 0.2 release
hosed my system. Took a fair while manually deleting dodgy libraries and
stuff to get a working gnome again. At least with RPMs you can easily
uninstall!

BTW, Im running evolution 0.2 (using the binary RPMS) and noticed that
the calendar and addressbook icons don't do anything. Is this a bug, or
are these just not implemented yet? Seems to send and receive mail OK,
and filters work for me, but I get seemingly random crashes when doing
things like creating new folders, and entering email settings.

Yes. We plan to do preview releases. We haven't done one yet.

Yes.

However, you may need to edit ~/evolution/config by hand and append a
path to the imap: URL there, to tell the provider where your mail
folders are relative to the default directory it puts you in.

Subject: [Evolution] Filters

Hello, 

I just started using Evolution 0.2, and I was wondering if you will be
implementing the ablilty to run filters on mail that has already been
received, ie your inbox.  The reason I'm wondering is that I just got
all my mail from the server and realized I didn't implement any of the
filters yet so I had to sort the mail by hand.

Thanks

Subject: [Evolution] IMAP feedback in 0.2

Hey.

Just downloaded and installed Evolution 0.2.... this thing is AWESOME!

Anyway.  I pointed it at my IMAP server that I have been using for 2
years under Netscape Mail.

From a protocol standpoint it worked PERFECTLY.

The implementation just doesn't seem there yet.

- Evolution is currently using INBOX as the default folder.  Usually
this set to the DEFAULT folder.  So it isn't really ever shown.

- The full path is always displayed :(  So instead of a Tree/Folder view
it is flat and then the full hierarchy is displayed.  So the following:

INBOX.lists.evolution@helixcode_com 

should really be this way IMO  It should be

<SERVER_NAME>
  - lists
    - evolution@helixcode_com

:)

- Retrieving messages doesn't work :(.  If I select one of these folders
nothing happens.  It can't be used in its current format like this :(

Anyway... keep up the good work :)

Hi Dan,

That's what a 'VFolder' or virtual folder is.  If you go to
'Tools->Virtual Folder Druid', it will
allow you to create a virtual folder.  The way that works is, you can
set up your filter criteria, 
and give it a name.  It will appear in the Vfolders branch of the
Folders tree.  (If you don't
see the Folders tree, click 'View->Show Folder Bar' checkbox.)  Then,
when you click on the
VFolder by name, it will automatically apply that filter to your
Inbox.  I think that's what you
want to do, yes?

Have a good one,

-Mark

--I agree. Excellent work!  I'm using IMAPv4 so not sure if these errors also
occur under POP3 or not. I've tried 4 or 5 times search 'Body or Subject
Contains' and it's bombed each time.  

--First time I used it it didn't exihbit the following behavior but now it does.
Clicking Delete will not draw a cross line until I move to another message.
However, if I hit the Delete Key it works fine draws a line through the message.

Still can't figure out when hitting Delete Key where exactly does it skip to
next? Based on from, subject, time, thread...I can't figure it out for the life
of me.  It'll go to messages I've marked deleted, or new ones, etc. Help.

--Request:  I like how when scrolling down a message body that doesn't fit
within the screen it'll keep the focus & continue to highlight the message so
one can hit the UP/DOWN arrow or DELETE key.  How about having PageUp and
PageDown keys to move through the body of the messages rather than having to
resort to the mouse to scroll up & down through a long message.  Perhaps
CTRL-PageUp and CTRL-PageDown would scroll a 5 or 10 or whatever messages
through the list view. This would speed up reading significantly avoiding the
dreaded mouse.

Or if the PageUp/Down keys are going to be for something else how about using
the left & right arrow keys.

--Currently is the timeout 5 seconds for having the focus on a message before it
is marked read? 

--When attempting to expunge messages from IMAP account it shows an unknown
error.  I'm logging ALL INFO on the IMAP server and don't see a thing.  Is it
even attempting to?  Or is it yet to be implemented?

--When I was REPLYING it wouldn't wrap the text and far right side the end
wouldn't show any text.  So I typed the remaining text which I thought it didn't
take (since it didn't display it) and BCC'd myself and it actually did take the
input. Weird. I just tried this in COMPOSE and it did wrap text so go figure.

--Refile a message to Trash folder it says unable to create the folder even
though it's already created.  Refile a message to a Local folder doesn't work
either. Error couldn't retrieve message 1219 from imap server. POP users does
Refiling work for you?

Yes vfolders can be used to do something similar, but its not quite
the same.  And yes, we plan to implement this feature, like 'apply filters
to folder xxxx now'.

Subject: [Evolution] desperately seeking evolution (still trying to compile)

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.
--------------2E0DA2FF0507E7ECB561BC4A
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Ok, I set my ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/share/aclocal" and I moved the libtool.m4 there by hand after compiling and

installing libtool.

Now, when I try to compile ORBit, I get these errors: see attached orberr file...

And when trying to compile bonobo, I get these errors: see bonoerr file...

Basically, I'm getting a million duplicated macro errors.

I really want to get the project to compile so that I can try to contribute. But I'm not familiar with the workings of

autogen and configure scripts and macros... If someone can help me get over this initial step, I'd really appreciate it.

thanks again...

michael

Subject: [Evolution] several annoyances

Hi,
	Evolution looks good, but that's about as much as I can say.
I installed the rpms for my RH6 6.2 system and ran into a few problems:
I am using my local mbox to access mail.

1. Can you / will you be able to import mail from Pine in a simple manner?
(I just copied stored mail to mbox) 
2. The Tools and Actions menus (I think they are called, I have the
Swedish menus) have no contents.
3. Deleted mail is not deleted.

Cheers,
	Bo

Try without the -I /usr/share/aclocal, it should look there by default?

Otherwise, its because you ahve some duplciajted m4 files - remove the
older versions.  It'll only work if you only have 1 of each file
basically.

On my IMAP server, mailboxes are in ~user/Mail/
When I add the source, and restart Evolution, the Folder view gives:
- Mailserver
  - Mailbox1
  - Mailbox2
  ...
However, when I click on Mailbox1, it doesn't open, and on the stderr/stdout
screen I get: cannot open /Mailbox1.

If I change ~/evolution/config to read imap://server/Mail/, the Folder
view gives:
- Mailserver
  - INBOX
and nothing else.  Looks like it tries the wrong directory.

Subject: [Evolution] Trouble with rpms.

Hi all,

Please help - if you can :-)   I am running a RH 6.2 system with the
2.2.16 kernel.  I've downloaded the rpms using helix-gnome updater (the
updated ones that are out now 0.2-1) and when I try to start evolution. If
it's the first time it creates the folders then crashed. After that each
time I try to start it it just crashed with the following error output to
the term.

[kschar@scharknet kschar]$ evolution

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b. (Maybe
you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

ANY help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I'd really like to
see evolution running. It's got/will have all that I'm looking for
(e-mail, contact manager, etc.)

Thank-you very much!!
  Ken

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution Preview 2

Using helix-update, I downloaded Evolution Preview 2 and installed it. 

However, any attempts to run it result in evolution simply
hanging. Eventually it fails to respond to the SaveYourself command and I
kill it off.

I'm using RH6.2. Any ideas?

Thanks.

I believe this is a Bonobo bug. I have similiar problems when the

Tools/Expunge would do it... :-/

As a workaround try to use the default locale.

This error will also come up if the mail component is run
successfully, but crashes before registering with OAF. We'd need to
see the whole debugging output to know for sure what happened.

This means you have something in ~/evolution which is not what
Evolution is expecting... did you unpack your source tree there?

If you rename ~/evolution to something different and start it up
again, it should work.

I'll check this out.

Space/Backspace do this in 0.2. I think PgUp/PgDown should be used for
scrolling the message list.

Yeah, something like that. I don't like that feature myself but we have
not come to an agreement as to how this should work yet. :-)

If you use a PRE paragraph, it does not get formatted (that's the way
HTML works). But actually, horizontal scrolling is currently broken in
GtkHTML, so that's why you don't see any text when typing.

I think that Refiling just does not work with IMAP yet. Jeff?

The IMAP provider doesn't support searching yet, and unfortunately, in
0.2, we forgot to disable it from the gui. So yes, it will crash if
you try. "Don't do that then." :)

Yup. There were some bugs with signals not being emitted which have
been fixed now in CVS.

It should always skip to the next undeleted message. If you've sorted
the message list by one of the columns though, it will appear to
behave randomly. It shouldn't ever go to messages marked deleted
though... Anyway, this code is being rototilled a bit, so hopefully it
will be fixed in 0.3.

Try Space/Backspace. :)

> --Currently is the timeout 5 seconds for having the focus on a
> message before it is marked read?

Heh. No, 1.5 seconds. It will be configurable later. (Maybe in 0.3)

> --When attempting to expunge messages from IMAP account it shows an unknown

The IMAP code is pretty new, and I think that was left disabled to
keep people from losing mail. (I'm not sure though.)

> --Refile a message to Trash folder it says unable to create the folder even

Oops. Yeah, the default folders are probably slightly broken. If you
create a new folder (File -> New Folder), you'll be able to refile
into that.

Does this happen if you switch to the default locale too?

It sounds like a Bonobo bug to me.

Subject: [Evolution] evolution packages for Debian

I have built some Debian packages for Evolution and its dependencies,
and am releasing them in the hopes that someone out there will find
them useful.

These aren't of nearly the same quality as the Helix GNOME debs. There
are some known minor packaging issues, but things appear to work
fine. Keep in mind that all the packages involved are in a prerelease
state.

In particular, the gconf deb runs a program in its postinstall script
that requires oaf. This starts oafd, which remains running after the
install is finished. Feel free to kill this root-owned oafd after the
install is over. I don't know a good way to handle this problem, since
root could be running some programs that require oafd to be
running. That rules out killing it off in the postinst. I'll look into
things to see what can be done.

These have been built and tested under Woody, though they should work
on Potato as well. As with the Helix GNOME debs, I consider any
failure to work on Potato to be a bug. Please file a bug report if you
see any problems of that sort. ( http://bugs.helixcode.com/ )

These have been built for the i386 architecture - that's the only
machine I have available at the moment. Source packages are provided,
though.

The appropriate apt line is:
deb http://spidermonkey.helixcode.com/evolution/distributions/Debian ./

Share and enjoy.

Peter

Hi Dan,

Is this the debugging output that you mean?  Thanks for your help. I'm
anxious to get evolution going - all I've seen so far is screen shots on
the web :-(

SeeYA!

This has been fixed in the latest CVS, the reason it crashed was because
your IMAP provider probably didn't support SEARCHing, in this case
Evolution will now grey-out the search tool so you can't use it (eventually
we might code some sort of work-around so you can search on IMAP even if it
doesn't support SEARCH).

This has also been fixed in the latest CVS. I had forgotten to have IMAP
signal that a message/folder has changed so it was never updated in the
GUI. There was also one location in the mbox code that needed to have the
signals added, so I fixed that too.

I'm not sure :-)
I think this selection is based on how e-table widget handles it, and to
know for sure I'd have to ask Chris Lahey who isn't currently here.

I believe we have plans to attach key accelerators to as much as we
possibly can, and also have them configurable.

The current timeout is set to 1.5 seconds, we also plan to have this
configurable by 1.0

Expunge currently does send the EXPUNGE command to the IMAP server, but I
have commented out the code that marks messages as deleted, so expunge
won't actually do a whole lot :-)
I did this to protect beta testers from accidently deleting their mail :-)

The reason for this is because all text wrapped in the <PRE> html tag does
not get wrapped (all replied text is wrapped in <PRE>)

I have fixed this problem in CVS as well, the problem was that the current
state of the IMAP server wasn't correct.

No. Everything is fine when switching to the default locale. I dont
really know wether that is a bonobo bug, but since it throws all those
error messages it seems like it cannot get the german strings, right?

Thank you..

BTW There seems to be an order that must be followed.
Also had to use
    ./configure --prefix=/usr

With bonobo-0.15, gnome-vfs-0.2, and gtkhtml-0.5.. To get this far.  Is
this normal/expected?

Thanks..

Subject: [Evolution] Pilot support?

(thanks again for Helix GNOME and Evolution. They're great! Especially the
Debian support.)

I just downloaded Peter's new Debian packages to my Debian box. Is the Palm
Pilot integration there enough yet for me to give it a whirl?

if so, could someone point me in the direction to get that going? I know how to
plug my cradle into the serial port but not sure what to do after that. :-)

fwiw, I currently use JPilot to sync my Pilot to my Red Hat box.

thanks in advance,
david

Looks like you haven't installed GConf, or, at the very least - it's not
being found when you configure/build

Can you unprotect us in 0.3?  Everyone knows to backup their email.  I just
created another IMAP account and copied my .mbox'es over to my new account to
test it out. So I'm prepared to crash and burn all email.

Refiling (with POP) doesn't immediately remove the message from the current
folder although I would envision it will in future versions I hope.

Under Local (POP3) why does it display Draft, Trash, Outbox, etc. they don't
exist or work?  Shouldn't it be able to create those on the fly?  Only by
creating new folder am I able to refile messages into those folders. Yep just
reread Dan Winship's message and he indicates they're still not quite there yet.

Virtual Folder Druid.  I thought this was working somewhat.I tried creating
From rule / added address someone@company.com but couldn't get it to show any
messages.  Does it only apply to new incoming messages perhaps?  I thought
vfolders are supposed to look in the INBOX (for now..other folders in the
future) and display only based on the rule criteria.

So I put edited the address from someone@company.com to "First Last"
<someone@company.com> and it bombed.  Isn't " " and < > a proper standard?

Subject: [Evolution] To-do list does not belong with the Calendar.

IMO.  I think evolution should take its To-do list code out of the
Calendar and add it as another 'module' (or whatever component, etc) to
the sidebar ('evolution shortcuts').

I believe this was just left over from the Gnome Calendar.  Since this
is in Evolution now it should just become a module on the sidebar :)

Yeah, I haven't coded SEARCH support for IMAP yet - as I first need a
daemon to test it with :-)

It's an optional command, as stated by the RFC (rfc2060)

Yeah, I probably will...I'm pretty confidant in the code anyways

You mean with mbox (when you use pop it downloads mail to mbox and that's
where searching/refiling are used) :-)
And you're right about it not removing the file from the original mbox,
because the way it works right now is to mark it as deleted (which doesn't
remove it from the mbox folder). I believe future versions will behave the
same, but if people don't like that idea I guess we could do it the other
way.

Probably because the "mbox" file doesn't exist in those folders, it'd
probably work if you went `touch ~/evolution/local/Draft/mbox`

The evolution packages can be found on the second server listed in the

I realized this a little bit before I received this email.  When I downloaded the sources, I put them in a directory called evolution.  So I figured maybe that was the problem.  After removing the directory, and restarting evolution, it worked great!!!  Thanks a lot!

No, Pilot integration is not working yet. Two people are currently
giving it love though, so it's gonna happen relatively soon. :-)

No, the To-do list is a nice thing to have together with the calendar,
mainly because you don't just want to have a list of things to do; you
also want to have dates to go with them. The DateBook+ for PalmOS does
display to-do lists together with the calendar view, and it's a very
cool feature that I use all the time.

Also, you can store your to-do information in the same iCalendar file
that the calendar is using.

Anyway, I think we are also going to have a separate to-do icon for the
to-do list in the shortcut bar.

Subject: [Evolution] Problesm with threads

Hi,

I've just installed the latest rpms under my installation of Mandrake 7.0.
It all looks great but I'm experiencing problems with threading the
subjects. I'm getting mail from a copy of my internal UNIX mailbox so 
it's all pretty standard.

If I enable threading in the middle of an evolution session, then there
appears to be no reason for the grouping of messages (cirtainly not on
subjectx - re:subjectx). I've tried sorting the inbox on sender, subject
and date - in both accending and decending orders but it has no effect.

However, if I leave threading on, exit evolution and start it up again,
then the threading is all OK. That is until I resort on any of the above
or 'get mail' again. The the treading goes out of the window.

I may me slow and this may already be noted but just in case.......

Steve

Hi:

Just a couple of quick questions for a potential tester:

1.	Will Evolution allow leaving mail on a pop server yet so that I can
test it
	without loosing messages?

2.	I currently use Balsa for email - is there any way to import my old
mail into
	Evolution for testing purposes?

Thanks in advance for your answer, and for all your efforts.

This is a user account.  I also tried this using root and it worked fine.
Has anyone else had this problem?  How do you get it to work for a user account.

No, POP still deletes mail off the server... :-(

You should just be able to copy balsa mailboxes into evolution as they use
the same format

The reason this failed as a normal user is because it doesn't have the
required permissions to create a file in /var/spool/mail/

We are aware of this problem and we will probably need to write an external
movemail program that can be set setuid (you wouldn't want evolution to be
setuid ;-)

A temp fix is to give your user access to create files there, but for a
multiuser system I wouldn't suggest it

Hi Dan,

Trying again for the command line to load Evolution this time it did give
me a bit more of a message but normally it's just the "Could not activate
component OAFIID" message. Here's the one I got this time - hopefully
this'll help :-)

Thank-you very much!
  Ken

We may have to take you up on that offer :-)
I'll talk to Dan and Nat and see how they'd like to do it (my guess is that
we'll probably end up using the freeware one)

Okay, well there are 2 places where this can happen in the vfolder config
tool - 1 is "select messages with these characteristics" and one is "don't
show me any with these characteristics" so perhaps you are setting them
both? I dunno.  Also, filtering/vfolders are still under development...

That should work, but it may not be as tight of a rule...

Subject: [Evolution] Comments on Calendar/Contacts

Hi there, 

Just curious if birthdays entered in to the Contacts will be inserted
into the Calendar. I was thinking either graying out the field (having
the current date in there can be confusing) and having a checkbox to
enable the field. If enabled then inserting into the calendar would be
great for reminders. Also, does it make sense to store a year for the
birthday? Most people don't know the year that someone is born and it
seems more intuitive to have a separate field for the year which can be
left blank than to leave a non-valid year in there.

On the Caldendar view I like that the current month is displayed clearly
for the first three views, but it takes a little hunting around ont he
month view to see it in the first day's box. I can guess you're probably
trying to keep the gray bar above the calendar clean, but it'd be nice
if the month view could display the month a little more clearly.

Thanks for all the great work!

Ok, I played with this a little bit more and realized that the current
implementation is probably the best because you can have parts of
multiple months displayed simultaneously. Please ignore ;0)

 I can't seem to be able to specify multiple sources

 Same goes for addresses. 

 I tried adding them to the "source" line in config,
but it didn't work.

 Is there a way to do this by hand?

 Btw, I am using the rpms.

Usually email clients only let you edit To, Cc, Bcc, and Subject.
But what if we could edit the Reply-To, right when your writing an email?
Of course the To tag would still be the same as your REAL email address but the
Reply-To would be an easier way of saying "you should take this up with so and
so at helixcode".

And as for the From-List tag, I've seen a thing similar in the mbox format for
a while now. And it would be nice if that showed up in your basic headings when
you simply view the message as normal. 

Does anyone like this idea?

Just an idea.

No thats bullshit, mail dir permissions of 1777 are perfectly safe
on multiuser systems.

But some systems are a bit anal about "security" and make it 
setgid mail, and some require setuid root permissions to set .locks.

Anyway, I said eons ago we should have an external movemail progra
but nobody listened.

Yes, but evolution matches against the email address part, after
its been decoded frorm the message.  The from thing should work,
but the druid's got issues so it might not even b e creating
the rule propely (its in the midst of a reqrite).

This is planned.  But there will also be a little task list next to
the day view in the calendar, just like it is right now.

We are going to have a more detailed view of the task list for the
full-blown shell component.  In addition, the little view next to the
calendar's day view will be enhanced to be prettier and more
functional.

Subject: [Evolution] VFolder wishlist

I have been experimenting with evolution-mail's VFolders. I figured a
good test would be to see if it can emulate my netscape-mail folder
structure. My netscape mail folders are mostly of three types:

- messages from a particular mailing list
- discussions with particular people or groups of people
- emails related to ongoing projects (eg. work)

I was able to emulate the first nicely, the second sort of, and the
third not at all (my goal is to use VFolders, not actual folders).

The second could be achieved with a more powerful expression syntax (ie.
allowing "or" as well as "and", and allowing subexpressions), but a
shortcut option would be nice too (like the To-and-CC shortuct).

The third might be implemented by allowing users to assign arbitrary
attributes to emails (manual filing) and then filtering based on those
attributes. That might be tricky to implement but I think it would be
very useful.

While VFolders can't match my netscape mail folders exactly (unless you
can assign arbitrary attributes),  I understand there is a lot of
potential to provide features netscape can't provide (particularly,
overlapping views). In this area, I'd like to be able to filter based on
additional criteria:

- emails sent within a certain time period
- unread/new emails.
- unreplied emails.

In addition, for any VFolder I'd like to be able to easily switch to
showing only new (unread) messages for that VFolder, or alternately only
showing unreplied messages.

On the topic of unreplied messages, a custom email attribute might come
in useful here to be used instead of "replied". I would find it more
useful to record that an email has been "dealt with". For me, this means
either that I have replied to the email, or I have read it and decided
I'm not going to reply to it. Having this attribute means that I can
easily view all emails that I have not yet dealt with. I can imagine a
new column in the email list view with a toggle which I can click once
I've delt with a message. Replying to a message would automatically flag
the email as "dealt with".

There already is a GNU movemail program possibly it can be
used.  Netscape uses it.  I'm not sure about it's security but it should
be a good base to start from.

Every time I try to load evolution I get the following error

evolution: error in loading shared libraries: libgconf.so.8: cannot open
shared object file: No suck file or directory.

I've tried locating this file but I can't find any libraries that this is
included in. Anyone have a clue?

Subject: [Evolution] comments on todo list

Hi I've been playing with evolution, and noticed the following thing about
the todo list...

When I delete items, the item that becomes the current item appears to be
fairly random.  The behavior that I would prefer is that it went to either
the item directly above, or directly below, or chronologically above or
below..

In addition to deleting items, I would much prefer to complete the item
(which would be signified by say, a strike through of the item summary...)

It would also be nice to have the origination date and due date listed with
the summary (as well as a followup date, if it is added...)

A couple of nice features that I've found in other ToDo managers are the
following...

Have the Todo associated with a contact, company, and/or project.
Have it associatable with multiple companies/contacts/projects -
For instance, in the construction industry, projects are coordinated among
10s - 100s of sub contractors, contractors, architects, and engineers.  Thus
a piece of information often has to be tracked with many individuals and
companies.  Also, because many of the same companies and people are working
on many different projects, it is also valuable to track the project that
the task is associated with.

The way "Commence 2000" (a contact manager specifically targeted at the
construction industry) does this is by having three additional fields

To do for companies, projects, contacts

each of which has a widget that creates 'one to many' relationships

There are also four other fields that are somewhat useful

Todo for appointment
Related to task
To do Journal
Originated by

I think the 'to do journal' is somewhat redundant, since other views should
provide essentially the same information.

Other useful fields are the "Follow Up date", "Recurring", "Share", "Type",
"Duration", "Start date" and "date completed".

I'll try and find some time to do an interface mock up, to give you a better
idea of what they use for a layout..

PS - thanks for all of the excellent work that has gone into Evolution (and
the gnome libraries, and all of the other great GNU contributions)

Yes, as new releases of evolution are made, they will be made
available as updates.

btw, there is a reason why evolution doesn't use "." (~/.evolution)

I'd say one of the best lines of defense that we have is that Evolution will
not be integrated into your system like Outlook/Express are in Windows.
This means that a hostile email can't corrupt stuff on your system, it
might crash Evolution but that'd be the worst it could do.

You *will* still have to be careful about running shell scripts/executables
that come as attachments though, however we will probably have Evolution
save them to disk with your default file permissions (which for the average
user is 644 - meaning the average user will NOT be able to just run these
programs; they'll have to chmod them first).

Obviously there will still be dangers. Even using a mailer like pine or elm
you have to be careful about running attachments.

Hopefully Miguel or someone will answer your question with a little more
detail than I have, but I hope my answer has answered at least most of your
questions.

If you mean Bonobo 0.15, gtkhtml 0.5, gnome-vfs 0.2, libunicode 0.4, OAF

Did you download the supplemental files also? I had a problem similar

Evolution will be using iCalendar shortly (we use the older vCalendar
now), and it does support defining a hierarchy of related to-do
items.  This will be supported.

Thanks for your suggestions,

Do you plan to add category-support to the todo-list? I once hacked
this is gnomecal, and talked about it shortly during guadec (yes, this
is the category-dialog in gnomecal that still offers 'guadec' as a
todo-category ;-). I must admit you're Outlook-inspired dialog is much
nicer, though icons would be nice... However, would you be interested
to use this same dialog in the todo list? Or if someone sent you a patch?

(Some people say you have too much to if you need to add categories to
your todo-list, while others say you have too little to do if you have
the time to add categories.... however, i find them quite useful...)

There is no document outlining what the final version of Evolution will look
like

Evolution *will* handle news, a lot of the code is already in CVS

The same reason pine uses 'mail', and elm uses 'Mail', no doubt.

Its not just for configuration data, but for user data like
mailbox files.

Hey,
  In my helix-update list of mirrors I see one titled Evolution
Preview, located in Boston, type HTTP.  However, when I attempt
to connect to this mirror, I get an error stating that helix-update
was unable to download a list of updates.  I'm able to use the
other mirrors just fine.
  Because of this problem I decided to download the new evolution
snapshot by hand (and all the other packages necessary to install
it).  It all appears to work just fine -- I just felt someone
should know about this problem.

Regards,
  cyberclay

I'm glad it handles news. I was worried about that. Pan is too slow and doesn't
look right for me. Hope to see some interface for evolutions news soon. =)

I have a question...
Will you be able to use Evolution without the shell.
For example just open evolution-mail, evolution-calender or evolution-news with
it's own _seperate_ interface, or will we have to use the shell?

Tony

You'll have to run the shell. evolution-mail, evolution-calendar and
evolution-addressbook are bonobo components, they can't do much without
being embedded in something.

Subject: [Evolution] a few quick Qs

Four quick questions from an interested user:

1) will it be possible to have the threaded view non-expanded by
default.
(or have an option to make it non-expanded by default, if that makes
sense :-)

2) will evolution notice if mail is added to the mbox (eg. by procmail)
behind its back?
(atm, you have to restart evolution first)

3) will evolution be able to understand the 'Status: RO' lines in mbox
files (for imports, etc.)

and just to finish it off:
4) will the task list in the calendar have 'checkboxes' for when
something is done (but you don't want to delete it)?

thanks;

As usual, this being a 1.3.x release, I haven't even compiled this
kernel yet. So if it works, you should be doubly impressed.

Subject: [Evolution] Beginning work on evolution

Yay!!!! With the new release of evolution-0.2 I can finally compile and
run evolution! Thank you guys so much for your hard work. This project
is so exciting! 

Now that I have it compiled and running, I'd like to try to add a few
options I find convenient/important in other mail programs. I'd like to
try to work on the IMAP support. 

- There doesn't yet seem to be an option for "leave mail on server".
Hopefully this is the default, but I imaging there should be an option
in the mail config. 

- Also, mail within subfolders isn't being picked up. 

What about multiple mail servers? Is there someone working on this? I
dont know of another mail program that does this well, but I'd really
like to have one. 

So, where anyone have any pointers as to where I can learn about IMAP? I
have  experience programming c++ for linux/mac/win at deneba software (
http://www.deneba.com/linux ), but not specifically with mail programs.
I was the lead of the project to port Canvas7 to linux. But
unfortunately, they used wine, so I did not get to do a lot of great
gnome hacking like I want to. Canvas7 is a corel draw like mixture of
gimp and dia, or photoshop and illustrator, in case you've never heard
of it.

Anyway, I'm really hoping to help with this project. I've wanted to get
into some open source projects for a long time, but this one is
particularly exciting. The office I work in is married to outlook, and
its frequently a thing people tell me they can't live without and
therefore could never switch to linux. So I'd love to see a outlook
compatible program with all or more of the features it has! Since its so
hard to get people to transition from their software, outlook
compatibility is important. 

If anyone has any pointers for me, I would greatly appreciate them. I'm
gonna go start looking at the source and looking for imap info now...

Thanks again!
 michael

Hrmmfrmmhmmfrrmmhmmhmmfruuummm...

Oh, excuse me, I had my foot in my mouth. 
Now that I've read a little of the imap documentation, I see there isn't
much need for a "delete from server" option for imap. That must be a pop
option. And looking at the evolution-0.2 announcement on the mailing
list, I see that we only recently got basic imap support thanks to jeff.

I found some imap docs at, who would've guessed? http://www.imap.org

So, I'll continue to read them and try to look at the source. Does
anyone have anything specific in mind for imap? Is there a spec of
desired stuff? 

thanks for the patience,
michael

Some users would like to actually have a 'download from server' option -
in effect using imap merely as a receiving spool the same way POP
is generally used.

rfc 2060 and related rfc's are good references (no doubt linked
from there).;

Well I think we want it to support everything  in camel, and
support it well :)  Jeff is doing
most of the work right now, eh shoudk now the state, and him, Dan, 
and Ettore shoukd now where its headed.

I know one feature which is missing completely is supporting the
search interface (assuming i just haven't missed it anyway)- Jeff doens't
have an imap server that supports it to test with.  It would
be nice also for it to support a subset of search operations
(those that can be determined from the summary only)
as well, since many imap servers dont support searching.
Not sure if anyones working on it yet, but it shouldn't be
too hard a thing to do (few days work maybe).

 Michael

Subject: [Evolution] imap subfolders

Looking at camel-imap-folder.c, I see that you always check that the
folder name is "INBOX". I'm guessing here that this is why none of the
messages in other folders are being seen. You do this in init,
get_message_count, and some other places. Are you sure that the folder
name handling is correct for the else cases there?

Also, I was trying to find the code for the "get mail" button so I could
track down why we're not getting imap mail. Can anyone point me in the
right direction? I was looking in e-shell-view.c and it looks like it's
the application bar? It that right? And there's a proc somewhere for
it(?)...

thanks

Disconnected IMAP is the most wanted on my list.  This is alot better than 
connected and offline.

ASAIK only tkrat handels this today (when talking about linux/unix-mua's)

Hi,

I've noticed that evolution was handling html attachment with ease, the
rendering is very nice and efficient. I've made some test with yahoo, altavista etc...
it works great !

I wonder if this html engine can be called anywhere in the gnome environment
using the bonobo component (like explorer in windows) and if there is any plan to
make a gnome html browser available with the evolution html engine ?

Thanks

Eric

I agree. Also, removing the grey lines between each message might make
the shape of the thread clearer (like in Netscape Mail).

On threads, I noticed a couple of minor bugs. Sometimes the messages in
a thread are shown out of order. For example, the reply might come
first, and the original message second. Other times, it shows messages
in the same thread when they should be in different threads. Maybe the
first problem is happening because the code assumes that the mbox is
already sorted by date, or that a reply always has a later date than the
email it is replying to. But that's just a guess.

You shoud rely on draft-crispin-imapv rather than rfc2060, as it specifies
what to do with no us-ascii foldernames, and that sort of thing. You can find
it at: http://www.imc.org/draft-crispin-imapv

Subject: [Evolution] Returning from Search

After using the Search function in mail, what is the
correct way of returning to a display of all the contents
of the mbox folder?  Right now I am clearing the entry
from the search box and searching again.

See ya,
Joe Barr

Yep, thats the way to do it right now.

It seems 'intuitive'?  Conceptually thats what you're 
doing anyway.  Anyone think of a better way to do the
gui for
this?

Well bascally, 'get mail' is only for pop/local mbox email.
imap merely queries the server for emssages.  get mail is used to
download messages into the local store ...

No, no sorting is expected freom the contents of th emailboxl.

The main criterea used for threading is the messages 'in-rely-to' and
'referendes' headers.  After thats all done, the sorting is based on the 
sent-date.  So yesl, this could be a bit out, since the sent date
depends on the sender having the correct offset from gmt int he
email.

The last criteria used is the subject.  So i find it very unliklely
that you are getting genuinly wrong threaded messages (its using the
same algorithm as used in netscape 3).

Perhaps a reset button next to the search box? I am forced to use M$ outlook
at work, and this was one of the little non-intuitive quirks I had to figure
out, to unfilter your message you have to search for " " ;-)

	I must add that i've observed this behaviour also. I was trying to
reproduce it but evolutions didn't cooperate.

 One thing that i noticed was the following. I am using imap to read the same
folders that balsa does, where procmail delivers the mais. In some folders
there were messages wich were marked as new but i couldn't read it. It looked
like they had been deleted but there was still a record of their presence.
Folders with this problem also showed the above behavior.

	I'll try to get a screenshot and then i'll post an url to it.

	See y'a

Hi,

I have compiled without problems all sources, but
evolution don't work. 
I received this message on my console:
Bonobo-WARNING **: Can not resolve initial reference to RootPOA
and a window with this message :  Cannot initialize bonobo system 

Did you have any idea? I could try to debug, but i don't find the option
in the configure to add the option -g in the compilation of source.

Thanks for your help

I'm checking to see if the mailbox name is "INBOX", yes. This is because
that is the ONLY folder that doesn't ever have a namespace. The rest of
the folders I need to prepend the namespace to before selecting it. And
I have no idea what you're talking about when you say "I'm guessing here
that this is why none of the messages in other folders are being seen."
If it's not working for you then please send me debug output? This works
for me and everyone else who's tried IMAP in Evolution recently.

Get Mail has nothing to do with IMAP currently, we may at some point
make it so that clicking on Get Mail will reload the IMAP folder
summary, but it would be better if I could get this working
automatically when we get new mail on the server. This is one of the few
parts of IMAP that needs to be coded (other than disconnected IMAP).

I don't appreciate the sarcasm especially since this is not the fault of
my imap code, and you can easily fix this by hand editing the
~/evolution/config file and appending the correct namespace to the
"source=" line

eg, mine looks like: source=imap://fejj@trna.helixcode.com/mail

We may even have this working in the mail-config code by now, it seems
as 
though it was working last night but I have yet to actually test it
myself.

Hopefully that helps

This usually means you compiled some parts against oaf and some
against goad. You will need to rebuild the parts you built against
goad.

If you re-sort the message list (by clicking on one of the headings),
then threading will break (in 0.2). Unsorting it (by right-clicking
the heading and choosing "Unsort") will fix it.

DO NOT do that! Evolution does not do any locking of its own files,
and if you change them while it is running, it may later overwrite
parts of them with "wrong" data.

What you want to do is to use procmail to filter mail into one mbox,
and then tell Evolution to fetch mail from that mbox into its own.

What does "Status: RO" mean? (That's not part of any standard AFAIK.)

> How will the way Evolution handles scripts/html/executables
> be different than that of Outlook/Outlook Express?

HTML: GtkHTML does not currently support javascript. If it does in the
future, Evolution will disable that. Evolution does not currently
fetch remote images in HTML message bodies, because that can be used
by spammers to verify that you've received the message. (At some
point, it will be possible to tell Evolution "ok, load the images",
but currently there's no way to do it.)

Scripts/executables: Evolution does not and will not have the ability
to run scripts/executables attached to messages. There is the problem
of, eg, an Excel document with a malicious VB script in it. This needs
to be dealt with by the app being used to display the attachment. (In
this case, Gnumeric, which will use GNOME BASIC to safely run the VB
script without damage to your environment.) But this means that any
program used to display an attachment needs to be audited to make sure
it's safe against malicious data.

 Actually I was kidding you, but technically it was
sarcasm. Yep it isn't your code, and I fixed it by
going the full path thinggy a couple of days ago.

 But this led me to: why the heck doesn't starmail of
the very bloated StarOffice spend so much time on my
imap even though I didn't give it any namespace? 

 The answer is because it defaults to:

 INBOX, Trash

 and that's it. Now It shows me a list in an option
window so that I could "subscribe" to folders. Exactly
like Netscape news thing. But it somehow is faster
since it doesn't try to download all the folders at
once (like netscape and evolution do) but each when
needed (when a dir is expanded in other words it will
fetch it one level down and stop). I think in the end
this approach is faster. 


 Peace

Subject: [Evolution] Default VFolders

 This might have been discussed to death. But in case
it wasn't I think the following would be nice for the
vfolder trick to be cool.

 Highlight the from address in each message and give
it a callback so that by left-clicking I'd jump into a
temporary vfolder containing all this person's mail.
By right-clicking I'd be able to create a permanent
vfolder for this person or add this person to my
address book.

 Have default unread vfolder.

 Same of course goes for sent messages. Say I want to
look for messages I sent to foo.....

We'll have categories for calendar events & todo items.
Chris Lahey has written a nice category editor for the address book, which
we'll probably pinch (is that what you were referring to?).
We just need to change the default list of categories for this.

I'm creating a new dialog to edit tasks now, so I'll probably add it.

I have a bunch of folders on my company's outlook server. They show up 
in the folder bar as being at the same level as the inbox but they're 
empty. Should I look into this or is there something else thats more 
pressing? What parts are you working on, I don't want to dupilcate any 
effort.

Yeah, that method may be faster and we may want to do that eventually.
Currently, though, the front-end is not very imap loving :-)
We'll be fixing this as we go... Hopefully by M3 IMAP will be integrated
more smoothly.

It's known that Evolution has issues with Exchange servers, if you
happen to figure out the problem great, if not we'll be installing an
Exchange server locally here that I can use to help debug.

Yes. I thought Federico wrote it. Chris did a very nice job!

Very nice. Good luck.

Subject: [Evolution] calendar appointments with attached notes

Hello.

I've been trying Evolution (the 0.2 RPMS) and so far I like it.

The calendar program on my Palm Pilot allows notes of an arbitrary
length to be attached
to an appointment. Is there any way to do that in the Evolution
calendar, or is this feature
planned for the future?

By the way, the thing that excites me the most about Evolution is the
prospect of
being able to use a M$ Exchange server's calendar, address book, and
e-mail
services from a Linux workstation. If that pans out, my wife won't have
any excuses
left for continuing to use Windows!

Thanks.

--Tony

This is planned, and will be in place with the new iCalendar support.
Basically you just stick your text in the DESCRIPTION field of an
iCalendar component.

Nothing in this example, of course - but then, that was sent using mutt.
The message I sent before that was sent with evolution, and had a From
line of

From: <>

(which is why it was filled in to "evolution-admin" by the mailing list
software) even though I had correctly set my identity.

Clicking on [Clear] would do a blank search resetting the view.  This is quicker

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution mailbox format - converting from ...

First of all, well done to evolution developers. It is looking good.

Now to my question. I used evolution to read mail from my local inbox in
/var/spool/mail

It has taken all the mail and converted it to a different format. Is the
new format some standard format, and is there a utility to convert it back
so that I can use pine to access those messages which were still in my
inbox?

Guy.

It hasn't really changed the format.  pine is just more particular
ab out what it epects as a From line.  Look back in the message
archives, someone had something for this.

What if you only took away the lines from within a thread but there would still
be lines between messages which arent in the thread? Is that what you meant?

mutt (& some other mailers) use it in the header to indicate that the

the solution i came up with was this:

create a user 'bob' in my normal user's group, w/ just pop access.
make /var/spool/mail/bob group-writeable

put this at the top of my ~/.procmailrc:

:0 Dc:
/var/spool/mail/bob

set evolution to pull mail from 'bob's pop account.

and that works.

Subject: [Evolution] Thoughts on Preview 0.2

Hello,

I've been using Evolution Preview 0.2 for the last few days and would
like to offer some feedback mostly on UI issues. I'm sure that a
number of these issues are already planned to be addressed in future
releases, but I thought I'd bring them up before it's too late, so to
speak.

  My primary machine is a thinkpad 240 which has a rather tiny screen
  measuring in at 800x600. Evolution uses a lot of extraneous screen
  space which makes reading mail less efficient. These suggestions
  might help tighten up the use of space.

    * The button bar beneath the menu. I hope that it will be possible
      to a) hide the text, b) hide the icons, c) hide the whole
      bar. These button's actions would be soon replaced by
      function-key combinations for many people.

    * The shortcut bar. This uses up an incredible amount of screen
      space for limited functionality. Again, here it'd be nice to be
      able to hide the icons, text or both. A horizontal orientation,
      maybe at the bottom of the window I think would work better. The
      icons could highlight depending on which component you're using
      at the moment. (small icons)

    * It would be nice to be able to change the list and message
      default font sizes.

    * The various druids pop up many many many dialog boxes. I think
      many of these could be better integrated as fields rather than
      independent dialogs. Tabbed dialog boxes would also help reduce
      clutter.

 Other UI ideas:

    * along the grey bar where it says "inbox": What if the "inbox"
      was really a pop-up menu which let you choose between your
      folders? This would save me lots of space.

    * once a search is completed successfully, a
      button/key-combo/menu-item to turn that search into a virtual
      folder.

    * Can I Vfolders encompass everything. I.E. Everything (contacts,
      emails, chats, appointments) with Big Boss?

    * I'd like to be able to drag and drop emails into folders.

 Minor issues:

    * When I select Tools->Filter Druid... (or VFolder Druid), the
      dialog box which appears has a misleading descriptor. Shouldn't
      it be "Select rule" rather than Select rule type"? Isn't it
      displaying the rules which are already set up for filtering
      rather then categories for rules? or am I missing something.
      Also, in this dialog box, it would default to a quick glance
      what my filter are, so rather than listing them by type, it'd be
      nice to see their descriptions filled in. I.e. If I have a
      filter "Copy incoming messages from a certain address to
      specific folder" can it default to the supplied values: "Copy
      incoming messages from 'Anne Hunter' to 'trash'"

    * When selecting multiple messages, it would be nice if the read
      status would not be changed. When I select a bunch of mails,
      it's usually to refile them, and I don't want their "read"
      status changed.

    * When refiling, only the folders of the correct type should show
      up. If I can't move my email to my contacts, why am I even given
      the choice?

I am terrificly impressed with the work the Evolution team has
done. My commendations on your progress. I hope these suggestions are
useful.

       Rony

This seems to work:

sed -e 's/^From - $/From foo@bar  Wed Jul 19 08:52:14 2000/' \
~/evolution/local/Inbox/mbox | formail -I 'From ' -s formail \
>newmbox

Or if you don't mind all the "From " lines containing junk, just
do the sed part :)

By the way, would it be possible for Evolution to generate
"^From " lines of the form "From user@host  `date`"?  Even if
"From - " is valid, pine, elm, mutt, formail etc. don't think
it is.  It would be nice to interoperate better with other
MUA's.

Well, a workaround for this is to drag the toolbar out of the
window.  (Drag the vertical bar on the left of the toolbar.)
Then just bring the window to the front again.  :)

Well, you can hide the whole thing by clicking on
View|Show shortcut bar.

Outlook can be made to do this.  I think it would be useful.

My 2 cents.  I use Outlook at work and Netscape 4.7 at home.  Both will
show me (at times) the reply before the original, so I am guessing it's
the user having the wrong time for thier client (as was mentioned
before)...

I assume it's so that you don't have your POP/IMAP passwds
hanging around in memory and also so that if you leave your desk
for a bit, but don't log out/lock your display, nobody else can
download your mail and read it while you're gone :)

Then again, if you're going to go to the trouble of "forgetting"
your passwords before you leave, you may just as well lock your
desktop...

Please someone correct me if I'm wrong.

 Why movemail?

 Why the heck can't email apps read the sys mail in
/var/whatever/mail instead of moving it to their
folder?

 Netscape does this, evolution does this, others need
imap access to localhost for God's sake!

 This is ugly. If I am away, can't connect via X to my
machine or for any other reason, then I can't use
pine, elm or any other email tool to read system mail,
no instead I need to change folders and such to get to
that mail.

 Why? Why? Why?

Seems like an interface issue. How about a feature that says "On startup,
go to this folder". Solves the problem isn't it since your concern seems
to be having to change folders.

Yeah!  You should just do what Netscape does!

Oh wait.

Netscape supports an external movemail.

You can do this by putting the appropriate categories in your
contacts.  I have my own "groupies" category, but alas, Evolution
keeps displaying an empty set for it.

If we eventually use a GtkHTML component to edit the long description,
how is this going to work with the Palms? They can only handle plain
text, right?

I suppose we can convert to plain text to send to the Palm, but if
the description is edited on the Palm any formatting may be lost.
Just warn the user?

Subject: [Evolution] New user setup and existing vCards

I just downloaded and installed Evolution 0.2.  The new user setup 
script worked well, and things seem to be running smoothly.  I 
copied my existing gnomecal vCal file over "~/evolution/local/Calenda
r/calendar.vcf"; however, the addressbook seems to be in database 
format.  How do I incorporate my existing vCards into Evolution 
without reentering the data (or some other piece-meal method)?  Is 
there a script out there to insert the vCards in my GnomeCard file 
into the database?

I know Evolution is far from production-ready, but I would like have 
a bunch of data around to test Evolution in a more realistic manner.

Regards,

Sourav Mandal

 That might solve problem for some, but I really see
no reason why mail should be moved anyway, unless
that's what I want to do!

Erm. I didn't say it was impossible. I said it was "hard to do". Which
file locking mechanism do you suggest we use for mail? I'm largely
unfamiliar with Python so I have no idea how they do it in a portable
fashion.

I guess if the user tries to sync back an object from the Pilot that
already exists in Evolution, and if the Evolution object has HTML data
in it, we can put up a warning to tell the user that the new
description will lose all HTML information.

Most of the time this should not be a problem; only people with too
much time in their hands (i.e. those who do not need a calendar) spend
the time to put bold and italic and fonts in their appointment
descriptions :-)

I meant to have a flat background with no lines anywhere. This is how
netscape mail does it, and I find it easier to read. Maybe it is also
because I prefer the font netscape uses (can we configure this in
evolution too?)

X-Mailer: Balsa 0.9.0

I think on of my main attractions to Evolution, concerning the GUI, was that it
had lines like Outlook Express 5 for MacOS. Which for me is easier to read
because it just looks nicer, in my opinion. But, I am using Balsa which doesn't have
lines and it works just fine for basic mailing needs. It's just so confusing to
have it all packed into one field and not seperated. But I think that because of
the way widgets are set up we would either have to add a lot more code for
options or just leave it the way it is right now.

Does Outlook Express have a threaded view? If so, how does it display
it?

 I am not an expert at this. The only I worried about
file locking, I discovered under python that there was
a posix way of doing this. Now all unix's and even
windows nt are posix compliant.

 Python always provide a layer to make things
portable. Anyway, as far as I know the module is
called fcntl and is an interface to UNIX fcntl and
ioctl routines.
 The locking is done via FCNTL.F_SETLK/FCNTL.F_SETLKW.

 That is the most I could get. You'd have to look at
code to see how they make this portable.

Thought so. Take a peek at the URL Jamie posted that dealt with how
Netscape dealt with movemail. Note the comments about fcntl locking and
what happens when you apply it to NFS. This is part of what I was talking
about when I said it's hard to do.

X-Mailer: Balsa 0.9.0

For MacOS in version 5.0 it does. Basically it is like Netscape Communicator,
but it is much more fluent and has lines between each message. It shows them by
date, which can be out of order because of timezones, lag and wrong-set clocks. It
is the exact same way in the OE5 newsreader. The other feature I love about
OE's list display is that you can choose which headers you want to show up. I
should mention that the OE5 display widget is based on MacOS's Finder "Sort/List
View" widget which is much nicer than the actual OE5 thing. 

I really don't think that this is any big deal, it's just a widget and will
probably be changed as Gtk+ progresses and new themes are invented. And it might
just be a lot better for everyone if all of the widgets in Evolution had
_options_. Personally I think every single widget in Gtk+ and all related programs should
have more options! Do any of you remember KDE 1.1.2, the way you could tweak
the widgets? They messed that up in 2.0 but Gtk+ is very flexible and could use
more options. Just add more technical stuff to the "Applications" panel in
"Control Center" <gnomecc> and rename it Widgets.  

I was just wondering, will all the widgets that are in Evolution be availible
through Gtk+ in the future? I really like that Shortcuts bar and would like to
use it in other programs without copying the code. It would be nice to see some of
that as plain old Gtk+ widgets.

I remeber reading about posix compliant and what that means once.  You
wont like the answer but it means next to nothing.

To be posix compliant all the functions must exist, but do not actually
have to function.  So a posix OS might include posix function
wipe_my_drive() that simply returns a fail, and does not even try to
wipe the drive.  

By having the function return a fail code apps that call it wont just
fall over, and thats basicaly what posix is about. 

Corect me if I am way off here, but that my understanding from a single
article.

Yes but locking isn't the only prob lem, with some systems you
need to do the locking as root, or setuid a particular user.
Mail systems generally use .locks anyway.  Its the setuid/setgid
locking/maildrop access that is the bigger problem, but still,
its not that  big if you just move your mail to another database ...

Well the table 'widget' in evolution is 'not just a widget' really, its
a rather specifically written and complex wiget called e-table.

It probably wont be part of gtk, because etable is canvas based, and also GPL
(not lgpl as required for gtk+).  It does everything itslef, including
having pluggable renderers for each part, so it needs stylising differntly.

Why is this? One of the things I like about gtk/gnome is its pervasise
style/behaviour changability. I don't want to have to go about
configuring every little detail just so that it behaves the same.

Ok, I understand there might be many problems.

Now evolution, netscape mail, and others use some
movemail to be able to avoid locking, setuid, setgid
... Great!

Then please move it back once done with it. In other
words fake imap even on systems without imap! This
shouldn't be a problem since those files are local
even though they might be coming from nfs.

Would that be too much work?

Hi.

I installed Evolution 0.2 using the Helix updater as root and pointed it =
to my local mbox (fetchmail grabs from my pop3 servers)  Works great!  =
But when I use my regular (non-root) account on the same box, using the =
same type of setup (local mbox), I get an error every time I try to get =
mail saying that a lock for the /var/spool/mail/myregularuser couldn't =
be created.

The mailbox is okay, I think - I can use Pine with no trouble.  WHERE is =
Evolution trying to create the lock file?  I can probably just chmod =
something to fix this, I think - I just don't know what.

Thanks.

Because no other widget would do the job.  Its really as simple as that.

I dont know the plans in that area, but i presume they will become
more customisable, to match the rest of gtk.

Depending on your system you probably only have to change your
maildrop directory to mode 1777.  e.g. if it is currently

drwxrwxr-x    root    mail

Then you change it to 

drwxrwxrwt    root    mail

Dont use mode 777 as it is a security problem.

This will hopefully be addressed at some point (by 1.0?).

I don't have any clue what you mean by "fake imap".  As for moving it back, 
guess what... you get all the same problems back again. You have to deal with
locking the spool, because while you "moved" the file off into mailreader 
land new mail can have arrived. So now at somepoint to move it back you have 
to: (a) lock the spool. (b) incorperate the spool into your copy of the 
spool in some sesiable way. (c) put your "newer new spool" in place. (d) 
unlock the file so that the MTA can then add any mail that has arrived while
you were incorperating the "new to you, but old to the mta mail". 

By "fake imap" did you mean "create the illusion of folders within a single
file?  Yes that could be done, but it seems like an excessivly bad idea(tm). 

> Would that be too much work? 

Given that it makes the problem harder, I would imagin so..

hi

i have been using evolution it's quite good but also
quite big for machines without a lot of ram, it would
be good if the components (mail, contacts and
calendar) would be launched just when you press the
button to switch to them, not upon startup, that would
reduce memory consumpsion for those of us that just
need to read the email.

i would also be good if it would show a progress bar
when getting the email form the server...

thanks a lot for such a program and keep up the good
work!

Diego

Hi all,

I had a lookup at the latest (packaged) Evolution release yesterday and
I love it :)

I would like to see the IMAP support *greatly* improved though, it
currently does not work for me with Cyrus IMAPd server (it appears to be
using '/' as a path deliminator rather than a '.' which Cyrus uses), it
also seems very inefficient in it's commands, it issues around 4 FETCH's
per message, and even downloads the entire message body .. all the
fetch's could probably be combined by asking for all the info in one
command, and grabbing all the headers before body's.

I really think what the developers are doing with this is great, even
though it's immature I feel it will definitely blow all other graphical
mail clients away in the future :)

Yeah just hold your horses.  We thought it was more importatn
to have an imap that worked at all, rather than worked ideally.
So expect it to improve quite a bit with each next release.

So, I'm trying to debug the imap problems with exchange servers, but I
can't set a breakpoint in libcamel.
I type 

info shar

and I get a list of a lot of libraries, but no libcamel

so I try shar camel  and shar libcamel  and shar camel.so.0 and many
others... but none work. 

Any ideas how I can debug this lib? Why isn't it loaded, but I'm getting
imap mail?

You are debugging the evolution-=mail program, and not
just 'evolution' i presume?  (since its a non-linked component).

I also usually find i have to break on main beforfe
i can break on shared library symbols, and of course the
dynamically loaded stuff (libcamelimap for example)
you have to wait until its loaded by the application.
gdb goes spastic with the breakpoints if you then run again,
but its doable, if painful.

Indeed, BUT, you have to (or "movemail" has to) lock the mail
spool when you move it out in the first place, so if you can do
it once, why not twice?  I'm not saying it should be done, but
your argument that you can't lock it the second time doesn't
make much sense to me.

Subject: [Evolution] Fix for outlook folders at root level

Ok, I haven't been able to confirm my fix because it semes like none of
the changes I make are making any difference in the output of the
program. Maybe the library is loaded outside of evolution and I need to
force it to unload somehow, but whatever. 

From looking at the debug output, I can se the problem. 

When selecting a folder, which I assume goes to the function
imap_get_summary:
-first you select the folder with the name alone:
ie. for a folder named Storage...

sending: A00079 SELECT Storage

-this succeeds and you examine Storage
-then you status Storage to get the number of mesages. this succeeds
also.
-then, strangely, you select /Storage

sending: A00082 SELECT /Storage

which fails with

recieved: A00082 NO Mailbox name is invalid.

at which point you bail out. All of this takes place in
imap_get_summary, but my changes are apparently not doing anything, and
I can't break into the library yet. I'll keep trying to get it to
compile, I think you just have to change imap_command_extended, which
tries to select the folder first, and is apparently doing it wrong.
Maybe this is just for exchange folders, or maybe its just for folders
at the root level. Not sure yet. 

I'm really enjoying using evolution though. The tree view for replies to
messages is very cool.

Um, I'm not claiming that having to lock the file twice matters.  The 
issue I see is in rebuilding the spool in a way that is sensiable.  I don't
think for example putting the X-MUA-Magic-thingy most clients use to store
metadata belongs back in the spool.  With that said, the move-back would 
have to trim off all of the metadata; which would remove any chance of 
getting virtual-imap.  I assume by virtual-imap you are meaning the ability
to have folders without having folders. 

Maybe If i understood why you want this it would make sense to me; but 
basically I just can't see how it would be useful.

Well, I don't know what is meant by "virtual imap" either.  I'm
not the one who asked the question in the first place.  I was
just questioning what you said about not copying the stuff back
:)

The person who asked initially seemed just to want to be able to
read his mail with something like elm/mutt/pine when he only had
access to the machine via telnet.  As far as I can tell,
"mutt -f ~/evolution/local/Inbox/mbox" should do it as long as
you have everything in the Inbox and use VFolders instead of
"real" folders.  The only thing stopping this is the "From - "
lines that mutt/pine/elm don't like.

I have many more that follows.
It doesn"t crash evolution, i can use it (for a short time, it crashes
quite quickly after some pop retrievals)

Another point, when I create a Mail Folder it doesn't appears ..

Ok dude, I may have a useful suggestion ...

You have to make sure you 'make install' when you change the
codce -= otherwise i think you'll find its running th eold
versionl.  Oh, and you will probably also want to rtun 'killev' - 
otherwise the old components will still be running. (unless they've
crashed).

Give that a go, that will probably helkp your debugging efforts!

I did a make and make install every time I made a change and it didn't show.

How can you print from libraries? I tried

fprintf(stderr, "message");
but I would never see it. Does that just mean I wasn't running my code?

whats killev? there's no man page for it...

Yep, you're right - I was mostly just playing around to get the right info -
the latest code in CVS is a lot more efficient. It will still fetch the
entire message when the user requests it, but in the future it will only
grab the message 'part' that the user requests and cache them for any
future requests.

Are you running the latest CVS? I believe I fixed that problem (I could be
wrong though). I don't believe the problem was in get_summary, it was in
camel_imap_command_extended I believe (and a number of other places
actually).

let me see if I can reconstruct the problem...

problem code:
		if (url && url->path && strcmp (folder->full_name, "INBOX"))
			folder_path = g_strdup_printf ("%s%s%s", url->path + 1, dir_sep,
folder->full_name);
		else
			folder_path = g_strdup (folder->full_name);

fixed code:
		if (url && url->path && *(url->path + 1) && strcmp (folder->full_name,
"INBOX"))
			folder_path = g_strdup_printf ("%s%s%s", url->path + 1, dir_sep,
folder->full_name);
		else
			folder_path = g_strdup (folder->full_name);

let me explain: we need to check that the url path isn't just "/" because
the '/' is really just separates the host from the namespace, take the
following url for example:

imap://fejj@helixcode.com/mail

In this example, "/mail" is the url->path, but we've got to strip the
leading '/' off because that's not really part of the namespace. Now that
you've seen an example of a url with a namespace, lets look at one that
does not contain a namespace:

imap://guest@tazmanian-devil.helixcode.com/

In this example, the imap daemon does not use a namespace but notice that
url->path == "/", now - applying the original code and selecting a folder
called Storage, we get "/Storage"

tada ;-)

Sorry I missed you on IRC this morning

 Indeed, that's all I want. Be able to read my mail
with something else. It sometimes happens. 

 So, lock it or don't lock it or whatever, as long as
I can read my mail with pine, elm.... it's ok. That's
what pisses me for instance about StarOffice mail, it
uses a weird format to store messages.

 I don't know, maybe I am overdoing this, but that'd
be cool.

Subject: [Evolution] Deleteing Messages

HI All

How do I delete messages?  
I have gone and higlighted the message.  
I have clicked delete. 

I still have the messages....  So I click the actions-expunge menu...
I still have the messages.  Any day now I am going to be unable to find
my mail between the old junk.

Also, on a releated note, I like to read a folder, then select the last
message, select the first message and then press delete, but I had to
shift select every single message.  Will this be changed sometime?

And, releated to that, could the helix guys put up a web page of planned
features so that plain old wingeing users like my self can stop
requesting planed features :o)



Lets see, what else can I ask for today....  How about a solid gold
Monkey for all who purchase the CD?

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution through Helix Update

Greetings,

	I saw a message here a few days ago relating to this, but can't
find it now(it's been one of those weeks). 

	Anyway, the point of this message is that I also am unable to
download from the Evolution option under Helix Update. I am running a
pretty much stock (other than helix gnome) Mandrake 7.0 system. I was able
to download Evolution and install it from one of my work machines running
RedHat 6.2. Could it be a problem relating to the distro that a person is
running?

Chuck

expunge is probably failing.  there's probably a tonne of debug output
about why.

Netscape Messenger (win version) shows threads as such I believe with lines drawn like in Evolution
...[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
.........[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
............[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
...............[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
...[HelixCode stuff]
...[golden monkey]

How about just having
...[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
...[HelixCode stuff]
...[golden monkey]
...[HelixCode stuff]

If this comes out unformatted then basically instead of hitting 3 levels deep and indenting each
time for each threaded message just going one level deep for all with lines drawn. 

Also is the DELETE key going to be "smart"?  If one is NOT viewing in threaded mode and sorts based
on FROM....will it skip to Joe's #1 message, Joe's #2, Joe's #3 or will it skip to the next unread
message based upon when received.  It'd be cool if the user sorts...threaded or whatever instead of
having to use the down arrow key to navigate and then hitting the Delete Key to advance to the next
message within the list (whichever way sorted) that the Delete key will SAY ...."hit down arrow key
within the list view and delete the message."  

Currently I believe hitting the delete key skips to the next unread message based upon when received
or perhaps I'm totally off based.

It seems that as most apps evolve they squeeze more features in limited space and thus shrinkify
icons...basically do more with less screen space. To me it gives it more of a polished look. For
example on Red Hat 6.2 python anaconda that snake's icons are HUGE.  I wish they would shrink them a
tad and decrease the line space between the fields so one wouldn't have to scroll so much, etc.

How about saving some screen space in Evolution.  I seem to always hide the shortcut bar...either
squeeze it thin perhaps like a slim jim...or how about super-dinky icons (or no icons) along with
text [Inbox, Calendar, Contacts] on the dark grey status bar which current shows which folder you
are in.

And then how about changing the 'display current folder' location to the same light grey bar as
SEARCH is on the far left next to the big X.

Speaking of actions-expunge, it takes evolution 43 seconds to expunge
one message from my mbox, which contains about 4000 messages. Also, Get
mail took 38 seconds to get one message from a server on the same LAN.
Is this a fundamental problem with storing all email messages in a
single file, or can it be worked around? If not, how about storing each
email in a separate file?

If you're using IMAP, it doesn't support expunge in 0.2, to protect
your mail from Evolution bugs.

Those mean different things... in the first, you have a message, and a
reply to it, and a reply to the reply. In the second, you have a
message and two replies to that message.

This is important for when a particular thread of a conversation turns
useless. You can then skip all further messages in that thread and
pick up again at the next message that is outdented far enough.

Yes, it's a bug that Delete and N and P don't follow the visual order
right now.

Yeah, so does everyone else, AFAIK.

The former is. To expunge a message, it needs to copy the entire mbox
to a temp file without the expunged message, and then move it back. So
this will be slow.

Getting mail being slow is probably a bug.

> If not, how about storing each email in a separate file?

Yes, there will probably be MH and/or maildir providers eventually.

The UW IMAP also doesn't seem to support delete on mh
folders.

(But I'd be delighted to be proved wrong, or to learn
of versions that do.)

Seems to be a missing feature.  I can delete all I want in a Vfolder and
it 
wont work, but if I delete in the Vfolder, go to the Inbox and expunge
all is fine.

Reading Radagasts article on advogato made me think of an interface idea
that I've had for some time now that would likely be handy for the majority
of GUI apps.

Many Unix users desire the efficiency of the CLI, whereas a GUI often has a
much shallower learning curve.  Thus I propose the following...

A widget that is the equivalent to the command line, where one enters
commands in it just as any other command line interface.  It could be
invoked by a key combination and just hover at the bottom of the screen, and
probably only be one or two lines tall (just as the input box for IRC
clients...).  It would lose focus or disappear by another key combination
(for those tasks with which the GUI is more efficient...).   It would likely
not be out by default, but if it were a consistent command to invoke it, it
would likely be adopted by many projects, and used by many powerusers.

What do you think?

This is a useful gadget.  Emacs provides two variants of this -- M-x
for "simple" commands (where you just need to specify the command to
invoke), and M-: for more complex commands, where you can enter any
elisp expression and emacs will evaluate it.

(vi also provides the same thing, but I'm an Emacs user, so I'll stay
with what I know.)

The second (more general) form of course requires fairly powerful
scripting support in the application.  This is more work, but it pays
off very quickly for power users.

One thing I like about the way that emacs provides this functionality
is that it can be invoked by a keypress regardless of what is
currently in your main buffer.  So it's context-insensitive, even if
some of the commands you can invoke through it do depend on context.
This is critical to making it useful to those power users -- if I had
to click on a text box to invoke the commands, I'd probably leave
emacs for vi :)

Can you create a terminal version?  Seriously, I would like 
scripting capabilities external to Evolution, no matter what 
language it's in.  This way, things can be done unattended by power 
users.  Perhaps Evolution and the terminal tool, say "evoctl", could 
communicate via a pipe or IPC..  Or, say when Evolution is not 
running, evoctl could be a front end to capabilities in Camel.

Caveat:  I am new to Evolution, and some of my ideas might not be 
self-consistent or feasible.

CFLAGS.  Edit hte makefile and
remove -Werror from the CFLAGS variable.

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution 0.2 won't keep multiple mailbox settings.

When trying to set up a POP mail, and then a local mailbox, Evolution
0.2 is loosing the settings of the first account, and only keeps the
last one entered (regardless of which). Any ideas on what to do to fix
this problem?

Much thanks....

Subject: [Evolution] Interoperability API / Protocol ? Which way ?

Hi,

i'm working in a firm which developped an online Agenda (+AddressBook)
I'm not here to make an advert for it but to ask a few questions :

We're developping 'synchronisers' (aka small plug-ins to make your
offline and your online agenda in Sync). For the Windows platform, we're
Ok :

we've just finished with the one for Outlook (97 & 2000), Outlook
Express & Palm are on the Way. But as i use Linux to develop this agenda
(the online one), i'd like to sync it with whatever Organizer/Agenda
lives on Linux.

	As Evolution would replace (for me) GnomePIM and Balsa, i'd like to
sync it with my Linux offline agenda.

So my question is : how should i attack Evolution internals ?

For Outlook, that was OLE_Automation/COM, for OE it was MAPI, for Palm
it's a conduit, for Exchange it's CDO ...

Should i use CORBA ? Should i make adds to Evolution source ? Would
there be a plug-in system (one for Palm, one for whatever online agenda
you want ...) ? Should i use iCalendar ?

Anyway, you're making good work. That's really close to Outlook
(graphically). Would it be accessible via a scripting language ? (did i
say gb ??)

Bye and thanks for any response

Thanks for the tip. it now (seems to) installs no problem.
BUT now I am stuck on the ./configure step with evolution.
When running ./configure I get the following error message:

checking for pilot-link version >= 0.9.3... configure: error: pilot-link
0.9.3 required

I do not need this, can it be switched off??
It is installed via rpm from Helix-Gnome and I have also downloaded the
tarball and installed but get the same error when going back to ./configure
with evolution.
Any ideas would be appreciated......nearly there.....
dave.

Subject: [Evolution] Cant run evo

Just downloaded the evolution 0.2 files (all rpms, but compiled the evolution
code from source), but when I run evolution, I get:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751
d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

So, how can I "set OAF_INFO_PATH" to get it running ?

Cheers,

almost there, I hope!!!
OK, now I have all required packages installed and evolution seems to

But when I try to run Evolution it crashes with a segment fault immediately,
error message below:

You basically have to talk to the wombat (the Evolution server that
handles the calendar and the addressbook) for doing syncing.

The documentation is unfinished, but it will be worked on. In the
meantime, I can tell you we have people working on Palm Pilot
synchronization already (the code should be ready for consumption
relatively soon), and that their work will probably be a good example of
how to get things to work.

The "Maybe..." bit is assuming that the shell couldn't launch
evolution-mail. But you will also get that error if evolution-mail
crashed immediately after launching. If so, there should be some other
interesting error message printed somewhere before that one...

Hi !

When I send html mails with Evolution, I'd like to have my own defaults
(background/text/link colors). I tried to emulate this by saving an empty page with the
right settings in the editor, but when I reload it, the link color is replaced
by the text color. It's a bug ! :o)

Subject: [Evolution] Java interfaces for Message Server and so on?

I am not sure if this is relevant.  You feedback is appreciated.
The quoted article mentions Java APIs that might be useful for
integrating Evolution within enterprise IT systems.

Quoted from:
http://www.anchordesk.co.uk/anchordesk/commentary/columns/0,2415,7102840-3,00.html

Subject: [Evolution] IMAP nits.

This is looking good. A few nits, though:

I tested IMAP with the U Washington server on my local system.
To make my unix folders in ~/Mail show up as IMAP folders, I had to
enter "//home/jk/Mail" as path. The extra / can't be right.

I had to stop and start Evolution for the configuration to "take".

The IMAP INBOX no longer showed up when I set the path. I guess the
path is intended to be the personal namespace as specified in RFC
2342. If so, this is a bug. RFC 2342 specifies that INBOX must appear
within the personal namespace.

I tried to add another mail source with no path to get at INBOX. But
then the original mail source had disappered next time I started
evolution.

With no path, evolution asks the server to list all files on my
account. There's a lot of them, so there should be a limit. (I guess
you are planning to add the "only list subscribed" option at some
point, but a limit would be useful anyway, or at least a way to tell
it to stop.)

Tha mail source type is called IMAPv4. In fact, from reading the code
it looks like Evolution only supports IMAPv4rev1. IMAPv4 is an
obsolete variant which nobody uses - except my wife! I guess I can
come up with some code for plain IMAPv4 if there is any interest - I
have contributed IMAPv4 support to mutt in the past.

The ability to have a cron job import mail in to the beast rather than
turn up after a weekend and wait 5 mins while it imports N hundred
emails would be the first thing I would setup...  I hate loading
netscape, and having it hog the processor for a minute while it imports
a few hundred mails.  It's simply ugly, and ugly is often bad.

Also, one could have said script running every 5 mins, and as well as
importing, notify of important email without having to start evolution. 
Kind of like the reminders from outlook at the moment, though way more
usefull. Who wants to be reminded of an apointment when you could have a
message pop up telling you some jokes have arrived!

Anybody's open to create a terminal version, fortunately
we've done most of the hard work :)

As for background importing, well maybe at some
point, but not just yet.  Its certainly possible, but
I would suggest it can wait till post 1.0.

Subject: [Evolution] User defined lists and text fields

Something that would be really cool to have, would be user defined pull down
lists.

Thus, say I'm in the construction industry, and I deal with five primary
types of professionals.  Then I would like to define a new pull down list as
Profession - and add the elements of {Architect, Mechanical Engineer, Mason,
Electrical Engineer}.  Also, if in the future I start dealing with other
professions, I would like to append {Plumber, Landscaper, etc.}

This would make Evolution vastly more flexible than any of the other contact
managers out there, and would make it quickly customizable by profession.
(Much more so than just user defined fields, something which some contact
managers already have...).

It would also be cool to have user defined free text fields.  (Not just a
notes field necessarily.  There are category specific notes that I would
like to define in order to reduce the search area/time, as well as ease
report making, and exporting...)

Thus it would be relatively trivial to for any user to imitate any of the
current Contact Managers and to add any customization that would be valuable
for them.  This is something that will knock all of the other contact
managers out of the park...  (Incidentally, I've been doing a review of
contact managers and 'Business Intelligence', Customer Relations Management
(CRM), and Technical Support software (most of which are just glorified
contact managers...) software for my company.  They generally are inflexible
and have horrid UIs, but they all have a few features that are invaluable to
an industry niche, and thus capture a small corner of the market.  With
these additional features, we should be able to be 'all things to all
people' in  extremely short order and without any need for advanced skills.

Thanks for listening,

Tom M.

--0-846930886-964533725=:16894
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


 
I've been trying to compile the Evolution package, I've compiled all the dependant packages and they compiled properly. When I tried to compile Evolution, it requested GConf and gconf-config. I then installed GConf and it compiled properly. I retried to compile Evolution and it kept telling me that it couldn't find GConf 0.5 (which is the version that I compiled). I used the PREFIX option on ./configure where prefix=/usr. GConf is actually in /usr/bin and Evolution shoud have picked it there.


Am I missing something here ? I'm running on Helix Gnome. Besides that missing piece, I'm almost ready to test Evolution. An answer would be deeply appreciated.

Thank you

Make sure you have removed the 'config.cache' file in te top of
the build tree, it sounds like it didn't find it, then
is now caching it and isn't seeing the installation (from the
steps you've outlined at least).

You don't need to specify the full path, you can setup your source as:
source=imap://user@host/Mail

that will work, and remember: the first '/' is a separator and NOT treated
as part of the namespace, that's why you found you needed "//"

Oh, hmmm - you probably did this through the editor - ok, the editor is
"broken" as it does need the first char to be a /, I'll have to see if I
can't get it so that is automagically assumed

I don't see why it souldn't show the INBOX... always works for me

This is because Evolution can't handle more than 1 server right now (this
will change in the near future)

Yes, currently it's just using a LIST instead of an LSUB command, until we
have a way to subscribe in the UI, I will probably leave it as LIST

Yes, I'm basing this on IMAPv4rev1
I could probably add support for v4 also

OK,
I have got rid of the error message:

OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443
751d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

by deleting my evolution directory in my home folder and typing:

export OAF_INFO_PATH=/usr/local/share/oaf

in a shell prompt.

But now when I try to run evolution I do not get a crash, it recreates the
evolution folder in my home doirectory, but nothing else happens!!!

any solutions, please????

Dave.

It could be a permission problem. 
I had two hosts: one with a working Evolution, on the other only root
could use it (it crashed with the same message as yours).
I got it working by changing owners and modes ;-)

So my current configuration is as follows:

oaf installed in /usr/share/oaf and /usr/bin/oaf*
evolution on /usr/bin/evo*

/usr/bin/oaf* 	--> 555 bin bin
/usr/share/oaf 	--> 755 root root
/usr/share/oaf/* 	--> 444 bin bin
/usr/bin/evo*	--> 755 root root

Hope it helps.

I have an exchange server I installed at a client's site.  I set up all the

I was wondering what type of support if any will be developed to support
Exchange. You guys are doing a great job so far.  I'll definatly be using
evolution as my Mail and Contacts manager at the office.

If somebody will post something and call it an "official" answer, I think
it's time to start making a FAQ.  There seem to be a lot of people asking
the same questions over and over here, and I'm sure everybody is as tired of
it as I am.  :-)  I can put it together, or maybe Aaron wants to do that,
either way, it should get linked from the Evolution homepage.  Thoughts?

Ah, but that assumes people will read it.

From http://www.helixcode.com/apps/evolution-faq.php3, which has been
there for two months or so, linked prominently from the main Evolution
page:

  My company uses Microsoft Exchange (or Lotus Notes). Will I be able to
  replace my Windows machine with a Linux machine running
  Evolution? 
	We will support as many (useful) open protocols as we can, but
	the first release will most likely not be able to interoperate
	with all of the features of various closed proprietary systems.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Subject: [Evolution] Evolution 0.3 "Jellyfish" is released

Hello,

the crazy monkeys have done it again: a new development snapshot
release of the Evolution groupware suite (0.3, code name "Jellyfish")
is out.

Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, and addressbook application.
This is mostly a bugfix release.

* Availability

        You can get the Evolution 0.3 tarball here:

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/evolution

        Evolution also requires the latest versions of GtkHTML (0.5),
        Bonobo (0.16), OAF (0.4), GNOME VFS (0.2), GConf (0.5),
        libunicode (0.4), GNOME Print (0.20) and ORBit (0.5.3).

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gtkhtml
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/bonobo
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/oaf

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnome-print
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/ORBit

* Changes since version 0.2

        Shell:

          - Pop-up folder selection.  (Ettore)

          - Added support for multiple views.  (Ettore)

          - Added support for saving component-specific settings, and
            some initial code to save the view's configuration.
            (Ettore)

          - Fixed the Bonobo menu code so that it works with all the
            locales.  (Ettore)

        Mailer:

          - Lots of IMAP fixes.  (Jeff) 

          - You can use an external setuid/setgid movemail program
            (although we don't ship our own yet). If you have one
            installed with emacs, the configure script will find
            that. Otherwise, you can specify --with-movemail=/path.
            (Dan)

          - You can toggle HTML/plain text for an individual message
            in the composer now.  (Ettore)

          - Bonobo embedding sort of works again, but there are
            problems with size allocation somewhere. Attachments can 
            now also be handled by external applications.  (Dan)

          - text/plain mail is now line-wrapped in the mail display,
            to deal with people who don't put newlines in their mail.
            (Dan)

          - Allow user to specify IMAP namespace in the mail config

Yay. Our first 0.3 bug: If you configure an mbox mail source in either
the config druid or the config dialog box, you need to start the path
with two slashes rather than one. (Eg, "//var/spool/mail/danw", which
will result in a URL of mbox:///var/spool/mail/danw.)

In both 0.2 and 0.3 I have problems printing mail messages. 

In both cases the print preview and the printed page have a solid black
band across the top of the page. this extends from one side to the
other, and is about 2 1/2 inches tall.
Printing from the calendar and the address book would appear to work
without any problems.

Gee, here's another reason to drop the ridiculous policy of mangling
the subject to include the list name:

Sigh, "mbox" instead of "mailbox"?

Unless there's some good reason to do otherwise, and I sincerely doubt
that there is, you should do mailbox URLs compatibly with Netscape 3.

The mailbox: URL is a way of referring to local mail folders, and to
messages within them.  

In 2.0 and 3.0:

  mailbox:pathname		refers to the folder itself.
  mailbox:pathname?id=xxx	refers to a message by ID.
  mailbox:pathname?number=n	refers to a message by number (the
				first message in the folder is 0,
				the second message is 1, etc.)
  mailbox:pathname?id=xxx&number=n    is the same as the "number=n"
				form if and only if message N has the
				ID xxx; else it is the same as the
				"id=xxx" form.  (This is for
				distinguishing between two messages
				with the same id.)

4.0 broke this, making both the "id" and "number" parameters manditory;
changing the "number" parameter from a *message number* to *byte
offset*; and making it impossible to refer to arbitrary files as
mailboxes (you can only refer to files that are under your mail
directory, because of their pathetic database usage.)

To those URLs, you can append some other parameters that override
the various display options on the View menu:

  &headers=all			show all headers
  &headers=some			show interesting headers
  &headers=micro		show the one-line header display

  &part=n.m			display a specific sub-part of a MIME
				message.  The numbers indicate the
				index in the tree.

  &rot13=true			rotate the characters in the text parts

  &inline=true			try and display attachments inline
  &inline=false			don't display attachments inline

Note that the mailbox: url doesn't talk about attachments at all.
It *only* lets you index messages in mbox folders.

Modulo the way 4.x screwed things up, mailbox: was identical to the
file: URL, with the exception that A: it was presented differently,
and B: you could use ?id= and/or ?number= to reference messages in
the (mbox) file by message-id or positional index (or both, with
error-checking.)

I lied a little bit above: all the attachment stuff (part=1.2.3 and so
on) is actually a part of libmime -- those parameters are parsed by *the
thing that displays messages*, not by *the thing that extracts messages
from folders*.  That's why ?part= works with news: urls too -- that's
not built into the URL handler for news: (or mailbox:) but into the
content-type handler for message/*.

Likewise, if you have a HTTP server (or a local file extension) that
returns documents of type message/rfc822, those will be displayed by
libmime, and URLs like http://foo/bar.msg?part=1.2&inline=false will
just magically work.

Note that the traditional syntax would be "mailbox:/a/b/c" 
(or "mbox:/a/b/c") as in "file:/a/b/c".  Saying "mailbox://a/b/c"
would imply that "a" is a hostname, not a path component.

Netscape interprets "file://localhost/a/b/c" the same as
"file:/a/b/c" and interprets "file://foo/a/b/c" the same as
"ftp://foo/a/b/c".

If you go to 'query bug reports', and just select
the default (or maybe add 'fixed' bugs), it will
give you alist of all of the outstanding ones.

Subject: [Evolution] crash when adding new contact

[I'm not sure if I should be submitting this bug report using a tool....]

I just downloaded the 0.3 Evolution Debian packages. The Help->About Evolution
menu confirms that it is version 0.3. I'm running it on a Debian Woody system.

anyway, I start Evolution, click on the Contacts icon, click on the Full Name
button, type in my first and last name, then click OK.

Then I see the red circle with a yellow bar in it. The debug message reads:

'Application "evolution-addressbook" (process 2706) has crashed due to a fatal
error. (Segmentation fault)

This is with a "clean" Evolution system. I haven't added any address book or
calendar entries yet.

[I can't really submit a bug report from that dialog since mail isn't
configured]

thanks for the great work! I'm hoping to start using Evolution regularly just as
soon as it stabilizes a bit more.

cheers,
david

Exactly. The problem is that a bug was introduced into the config
dialog at the last minute that resulted in the path having an extra /
prefixed, so you type /a/b/c and it mistakenly ends up generating
mbox://a/b/c, which the URL code misinterprets. Adding the extra slash
in gets you mbox:///a/b/c, which as you mentioned is equivalent to
mbox://localhost/a/b/c, aka mbox:/a/b/c.

As for "mbox" rather than "mailbox", that's just how Bertrand wrote it
long ago. I hadn't actually realized Netscape used URLs to refer to
mailboxes. There's no reason we couldn't change it, although it may
end up becoming "file:" instead and having something that
distinguishes between mbox, maildir, and MH style folders.

        Bonobo (0.16), OAF (0.4), GNOME VFS (0.2), GConf (0.5),
        libunicode (0.4), GNOME Print (0.20) and ORBit (0.5.3).

        Evolution users list by going to the Evolution home page on
        http://www.helixcode.com/apps/evolution.php3

but please remember that Evolution will still be buggy, incomplete,
and temperamental.

How about changing the subscription to send the FAQ to every one who
Subscribes when they Subscribe, have a local Shaman curse it so that all
who fail to read it fail to gain posting rights to the list and a forced
to permanently lurk...

 I don't want to sound annoying, but where the heck
are the rpms?

 If they are not here in less than an hour, I'll sue
Helixcode for psychological damage ;)

Subject: [Evolution] FAQs and requests on the slashdot article

OK, I just scoured the /. posting about evolution 0.3.0,

and here are the FAQs not answered in the FAQ

1) How can I/will evolution allow me to, see headers?
2) How do I automatically install with debian/redhat/favorite distro?
3) Can I easily migrate my mailbox to/from client Mutt/Pine/etc.?
4) What is the install order for installing Gnome, Gnome Libs, and Evolution
by hand? (i.e. no helix update, debs, rpms, but all from source...)
5) Will I be able to access my mail via Xserver, a terminal etc.
6) What standard mail protocols are supported? (We only mention future
planned support, not what is supported - ie most of MAPI and POP3 ...)
7) What is Evolution?  (Answered in many other places, but not in the FAQ)
8) Where can I download it from? (Again answered in locations aside from the
FAQ)
9) Where can I find documents on how to hack it?

Okay, that's it for the FAQs

Now for frequent feature requests -
1) Interact with the proprietary servers (MS Exchange, Lotus Exchange...
etc.)
2) seemless/easy GnuPG, PGP support (which we got a patch for yesterday -
yay)
3) Remote access via terminal/xserver

Hope you all find this useful

 You forgot rpm -tb the rest of the tar.gz. In other

Subject: [Evolution] v0.3.1 doesn't like my birthday (Date problem with contacts when saving
 changes via Icon)

Hello,

each time you save a contact via the save_icon, both birthday &
anniversary date
are 'decremented' by one day.

First, my birthday was 5/19/1977, i changed something else (Office
Field) and saved.
Reopening it, i saw 5/18/1977. Retrying it -> 5/17/1977.

Same thing with Anniversary field

Quite strange.

Accessory, the tooltip behind the save_icon is 'save the appointment and
close ...'


Bye

I've seen this before.  My guess is they are using the unix time stamp,
and are setting hours, mins, & seconds to 0, and the day doesn't actually
start till the 1st second.  There for it ends up subtracting 1 day when
you write the data.  At least that's what the problem was with my code
that did that same thing.

I just tried reproducing this and havent' been able to.  What OS and
distribution are you seeing this on?

That's what it does.  That's probably the most common thing someone will
want to do.

Hey there :) I'm new to the list, and at 0.3.1, I figured I'd be able to offer some constructive critisism. However, I can't seem to run Evolution. Here's the error:

reload
Trying dir /usr/share/oaf
evolution-mail: error in loading shared libraries: /usr/lib/evolution/camel-providers/0.2/libcamelvee.so.0: undefined symbol: unicode_get_utf8

Now, I installed everything in a very sane manner, and both tarballs(oh boy - that was a long compile) and RPMs give me the same error. I completely removed every trace of any installed file from the tarballs before I tried the RPMs(I captured the output of 'make install' for each package, and removed them by hand[more or less]). Thanks for any help ;)

This is a strange problem (bug?). It shouldn't be trying to load the 0.2
version of the vee module so I'm not sure what gives. What you could try
doing is a making a link from 0.2/libcamelvee.so.0 to
0.3/libcamelvee.so.0

Subject: [Evolution] configure does not find libxml?

Hi,

I am trying to build evolution-0.3.1, and the configure script seems 
to find all the important libraries until it gets to some xml check. 
There I get the error:

checking for xmlNewDoc in -lxml... no
configure: error: Could not link sample program

I know I have both libxml-1.8.9-1 and libxml-devel-1.8.9-1 installed. 
I even tried downloading, building, and installing libxml-1.8.7, but 
no luck there.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Ujwal

In my experience text wrapping works when composing a new message, but
not when 
replying to a message. In the latter case the cursor gets to the end of
the line
and then when you keep typeing the cursor continues to go right, but no
text 
appears on the screen. If you then use the back arrow to get to the
point where 
words stopped appearing and press return, everything appears as typed on
the next 
line.

Yes.  When auto* tests for a function in a library, it builds a small
test program (which it links) to do this.  If the CFLAGS or LDFLAGS env
var have been set during th auto* script, they are involved in this. 
Probably another library is causing the problem.  Check config.log to
see if you can figure out what library is not being linked properly.

Hi,

Since evolution 0.2, I am getting this error message (dialog box) while trying to send mail via SMTP:

Could not send message:
HELO reponse error: Success: non-fatal

I did not have this problem with evolution 0.1. Unfortunately no information is printed to the console regarding this error. 

Hope someone can help.

I picked up the tar balls from the evolution announcement site and oaf doesn't compile.

It uses -Werror but uses pointer arithmetic in a number of files. I had to remove the -Werror to get it

 to compile. It also uses -Wpointer-arith.

I'm using gcc 2.95.2

I looked in the config.log file, and it said that it could not find 
the asound library (-lasound). I searched the web and found that 
libasound is provided by the alsa-lib package. However, when I 
installed that, I still got the same error. alsa-lib provides 
libasound.so and installs it in /usr/lib. Should I be installing some 
other package?

Thanks,

I've also had problems compiling bonobo 0.16, but my problem concerns the gdk-pixbuf. Here is the error I got trying to configure bonobo:

checking for GDK_PIXBUF - version >= 0.6.0... no
*** The gdk-pixbuf-config script installed by GDK_PIXBUF could not be found
*** If GDK_PIXBUF was installed in PREFIX, make sure PREFIX/bin is in
*** your path, or set the GDK_PIXBUF_CONFIG environment variable to the
*** full path to gdk-pixbuf-config.
configure: error: Need gdk-pixbuf!

This is strange because my version of gdk-pixbuf is 0.8 (helix), and I couldn't figure out how to fix this.

Try running evolution-mail in a separate xterm

first make sure to killev, after that run evolution-mail and wait a few
seconds and then start evolution in another xterm, this should allow
evolution-mail to print debug info to the console

Ok, 

I ran evolution-mail in another xterm before starting evolution and here is the output:

 evolution-mail: Yeeh! We have an owner!
 Decoding addresses -- smaclean@ns.sympatico.ca
 Decoding addresses --
 Decoding addresses --
 sending : EHLO 192.168.0.2
 received: 501 Invalid domain syntax

 camel-smtp-transport::connect(): provider does not use AUTH

At this point, I get the error dialog box stating:

 Could not send message:
 HELO response error: Success: non-fatal.

When I telnet to the smtp provider, here is what I get:

 220 jubilee.ns.sympatico.ca ESMTP server (Post.Office v3.5.2 release 221 ID# 0-66967U86000L86000S0V35 ready Sat, 29 Jul 2000 19:10:44 -0300

Typing EHLO 192.168.0.2 (I am behind a masqueraded box) in the telnet session produces the same "Invalid domain syntax" error.
Again, sending mail via SMTP in evolution 0.1 worked fine with this provider. 

Hope this helps.

Looks like the ESMTP provider doesn't like your IP/hostname :-)

It should still send your email though, that's why it says "non-fatal"

I'm not sure how to fix the problem other than just making it so the 
dialog doesn't pop up

If you're using Linux, then probably not, vi is a Unix command.

Right now only the gtkhtml editor is working, but in the future
other editors will be supported.

Hmm, unfortunately it does not send the email. No other email clients have
this problem and evolution 0.1 worked fine. Has there been substantial
changes in the SMTP code since 0.1?

We have no-one working on this at present, but it's relatively easy to
do.

The message composer just loads a Bonobo Control which is then embedded
as the editor; you can replace the default editor with a different one
as long as the replacement editor is a Bonobo Control. So one could
write a ZVT-based Bonobo Control that can embed an arbitrary
terminal-based editor, and then Evolution could use any arbitrary
terminal-based editor.

The integration would not be perfect GUI-wise, of course, but if people
really want to use VI for composing email, I guess that's the only way.

Volunteers? :-)

Or the GTK+ version of VIM's "gvim" could be bonobo-ized. I think this
would make a great control.

I'd be into it too BTW. Dunno if I'd have the time to do it myself, but
I'd certainly use it ;)

Just tried out evolution some, it looks great, very smooth :) I would choose it in a instant I knew how to get it to convert my current GnomeCard and GnomeCal files. This would also make it easy to sync with my palm pilot. Or, I guess finishing the pilot interfaces would work also. Any info on either items??

Hm. Yes, that's wrong. It should be "EHLO [192.162.0.2]". That should
be fixed. I guess your SMTP server is just pickier than most.

I like what exmh does: edit in vi, prompt for send/re-edit/re-edit in
mime-aware editor/various other options.  When you have a message with mime
in it, you first write the plain test part in vi, then quit vi and bring up
the other editor, which mimeifies it and lets you add attachments.  Best of
both worlds.

Do you have gdk-pixbuf-devel installed? If you can't type in
'gdk-pixbuf-config --help' at the prompt and get output, something
is messed up with your installation of gdk-pixbuf-devel --
try 'rpm -V gdk-pixbuf-devel'.

Does it crash or just spout an error?

Subject: [Evolution] mail compose blank screen???

Hi All,
After unsuccessfully trying to launch Evolution preview 2, results below:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443
751d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

I have now downloaded Evolution preview 3 & the updated bits and pieces, all
install fine except evolution 3 will not ./configure for me!!, not on front
of the machine so don't know the error message now...

BUT, Evolution2 now launches!!!, it will retrieve my pop3 email, but when I
choose to reply or create a new message I am left with a grey screen, all
buttons disappear and I am left with no options except for quitting....

Any help on how to workaround this would be appreciated,
thanks, Dave.

I believe bonobo .16 is the latest version of it....they might have made a
mistake and meant .05 because on the helixcode site it says that evolution
.15 is required to compile. Just grab the latest one which is .16 and you'll
be fine

Well, generally yes .5 is > .15, but this is versioning, thus the . is just
a separator, not a decimal, so you should think of it a 15 and 5

choose to reply or create a new message I am left with a grey screen, all
buttons disappear and I am left with no options except for quitting....

Any help on how to workaround this would be appreciated,
thanks, Dave.

Subject: [Evolution] Building Evolution w/o Pilot support

This may be a silly question, but can I build Evolution w/o support for
PalmPilot?

Since I don't have a PalmPilot, I installed Gnome w/o pilot-link, or
gnome-pilot.  When
I try to build, I get an error that libpisock cannot be found.  I went
ahead and installed
pilot-link and gnome-pilot, but evidently I need the latest versions
from CVS.  Since I
don't have a PalmPilot, I'd really rather not install CVS code for
something I cannot use
or test.

Are there any special tricks to building without pilot support?  Maybe a
parameter to
be passed along when building?

Thanks,

Hi there,

I have Evolution 2 running fine, from a RPM.
I wanted to look at E 3.0 but when I try to
compile it I get the following error.

checking whether to enable maintainer-specific
portions of Makefiles... no
checking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu
checking for gnome-config... no
checking for gnomeConf.sh file in
/usr/local/lib... not found
configure: error: Could not find the gnomeConf.sh

any Suggestions.

Thanks.
Jason.

I had the same problem. You have to compile gtkhtml-package against
bonobo and oaf.

That is, make sure that you have bonobo and oaf packages properly 
configured and installed and then recompile gtkhtml. It's not necessary
to recompile whole Evolution.

When are we going to have some keyboard shortcuts? Using that toolbar is
quite disturbing.

Do you have the gnome-libs-devel package installed?  You need it.
The *-devel packages have *-config, *Conf.sh, header files, etc.

In addition, you will need to configure evolution like this:
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
otherwise you need to set GNOME_PATH and ACLOCAL_FLAGS, etc.
(or alternatively, you can build gnome-libs from source, and then install
evolution and its dependencies into the same prefix you installed
gnome-libs into).
Read the evolution/README file for more details.

The configure script should only try to find libpisock if it finds the
gnome-pilot package. You're sure you don't have it installed? What
does the configure output say in the lines before the error? What does
"gnome-config --modversion gpilot" say?

It crashes. This bug has already been fixed in CVS. Until 0.4, just
"don't do that, then" :-}. (Or you can create an empty mbox file in
each dir: "touch ~/evolution/local/Drafts/mbox", etc.)

Subject: [Evolution] Suggestion for required packages

The GConf libraries should probably be included as well on the Evolution
Additional packages list.  I don't recall if Evolution requires these or
not, but its certainly required by other packages.

Subject: [Evolution] Configure problems

Hi.. I am attempting to compile Evolution .3 and have run into a problem in
the configure script...I only have a vague output from it because i am not
at my computer right now but it is at the point after it looks for pisock
and when it looks for xmlNewDoc it tells me

cannot link sample xml program...

is there something i am missing....i have all the required libraries (i
think) for compiling evolution...If anyone has any ideas on how to get
around this and get a solution to this problem please don't hesitate...

:-)

I am also having this problem.  I'm not sure that our problems are exactly
related, but here are the last few lines in the config.log file where it
fails:

configure:6558: checking for xmlNewDoc in -lxml
configure:6577: gcc -o conftest -g -O2 -Wall -Wunused  -I/usr/include
-DNEED_GNO
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lasound
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
configure: failed program was:
#line 6566 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char xmlNewDoc();

int main() {
xmlNewDoc()
; return 0; }

As you can see it can't find libasound.a or libasound.so (I think)  I have
looked around and don't seem to have them, nor do I know where to get it.
supposedly from RPMfind, the alsaplayer package contains it, but it doesn't
appear to to me... I still have the same problem after I install it anyway...
I can't for the life of me figure out how -lasound is getting into the script,
so I can't even take it out.  Oh well, I hope that helps you.  I know I am
stuck though...

Subject: [Evolution] Quick tool to import a directory of mbox-style files

--XsQoSWH+UP9D9v3l
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I wanted to import my old ~/Mail directory with 15+ years of stored mail
into Evolution (a nice stress-test), so I came up with this quick and
dirty hack to mass-import a directory of mbox-style files and subdirectories
into the specified Evolution folder.  I'm sending it here in case it might
be useful to other Evolution users.

Useage: mbox-import /path/to/evolution/local/foldername.  It reads all
files and subdirectories, and copies them into the specified folder.  It
descends into subdirectories and does the Right Thing (I hope).  Each
mbox file is created as a subfolder of the specified folder, with 
subdirectories created as sub-subfolders.

Caveats: Only been tested with mbox-style folders.  Will copy any file,
regardless of whether it's an mbox folder.  Copies, not moves.  Shouldn't
touch the original files.  Only tested on my machines (RH6.2, Solaris 7).
YMMV. 

ja.

I had the same problem. It turned out the sample program tries to link
against libasound that I did not have. I had to the alsa-lib and
alsa-lib-devel rpms.

I had libxml 1.8.9 installed.  I reverted back to 1.8.7 (the only way I
found to do this was to get the 1.8.7 rpms and install them with a
--nodeps and a --force flag.)  "rpm -a -q | grep libxml" now claims that
1.8.7 is installed, but I still get the same errors, again failing to
link with the -lasound flag. (see previous messages in thread for more
detail.) So really, I still don't have much of an idea of what is going
on.   :>

Subject: [Evolution] Filters are gone :(

I spent like an hour doing filters for evolution (I was planning
on trying it as my work email client and I need about 20 filters)
the other day.  But I didn't quite get done with the filters and
I wasn't going to use it yet, so I just closed it.  Well today I
open it, go to Filter Druid to finish the filters, and NONE of my
filters are there anymore!  Can I get them back? Do I just have
to reload a config file?  Or do the filters no longer get saved? 
Thanks!

Misty

PS - I'm running the newest pre-release (not CVS) on RedHat 6.2
updated to the 2.2.16 kernel, on a Celeron 500.  Thanks!

Yes, I got evolution to compile and run, but I still hadproblems. Whenever I
hit the reply button, evolution seemed to hang. I had the libxml 1.8.9
package. I removed it and installed 1.8.7 to see if that works better. It
did. The "Reply" button now works. I removed the libxml and libxml-devel
rpms using rpm -e --nodeps, and compiled and installed the 1.8.7 from the
tarball.

Hmm...Strange....Downgrading to run a package...This will be a problem in a
future with other programs...I hope the evolution team gets ontop of this
problem.

i'll try 1.8.7 to be sure myself that it will actually compile.

Subject: [Evolution] Re-receiving email

I have been using evolution 0.3.1 for my email client for the last day,
and I have noticed that when I receive my mail from the server it works
find, then if I hit Get mail again before there is any new mail, the
last message received from the server in the last Get mail is received
again.  This happens until new mail arrives, then starts again with the
last message from the new mail batch.  I am receiving my mail over pop,
if this helps.

The other thing I noticed, is when your composing a message, if your
cursor is on a line and you hit end, you goto the end of your message,
not the the end of the line, I'm not sure how this is suppost to react
but seems a bit strange when the cursor jumps to the end of your
signature and you have to figure out where you are, the same with home
going to row one char one of the email.

I'm not sure that's a good idea because Evolution adds it's own headers
(X-Evolution) to the header when you use it's import feature, copying the
files to the evolution directory may work but there may be problems

Dan, any comments?

None of the current preview releases of Evolution support multiple accounts,
there is some beginnings of support for that in current CVS HEAD, but it's
still a bit buggy.

Hi Dan,

Is this an old requirement? I have libxml 1.8.9 installed and I can
compile CVS as well as the 0.3.1 tarballs. Am I just lucky? :-)

libxml-1.8.9-0_helix_1
libxml-devel-1.8.9-0_helix_1

Thanks!
  Ken

Hi Jeff,

That's kind of a bummer. Do you know if it's currently even being worked
on?  Cuz I think it would be much easier to try and use Evolution and try
to debug, etc. if I knew that at least the work I was doing had a chance
of being saved.  Whatcha think?

Thanks!
  Ken

Well, I could compile too, but the "Reply" button wouldn't work. When I went
to libxml 1.8.7, it worked. Coincidence?

Isn't there a way to do it with filters?  You can do on each
outgoing message, copy it to Sent.  

Of course, nobody ever got back with me about why my filters
weren't saved....

These are the two errors I get

`goad_Server_activate_with_repo_id'

What's wrong with it. Does it have anything to do with gnome-pilot or

Thanks ahead of time,

Are you running Mandrake 6/7? Their gcc is buggy and breaks with a lot
of packages. Try switching to Red Hat's gcc. I'm running Mandrake 6.1
with the Red Hat 6.0 gcc.

Subject: [Evolution] filter happiness and sadness

The good news: the filter "to" rule is now a "to or cc" rule.

The bad news: I fixed a spelling mistake at the same time, thus
breaking existing filters and vfolders. If you have filters or
vfolders defined, you need to change all occurrences of "receipient"
to "recipient" to make them work again after you next "make install"
in evolution/filter.

Eg:

M-x replace-string [RET]
receipient [RET]
recipient [RET]

Have a nice day.

So I take it CVS snaps have the ability to actually respond/create mail?  I
ask because the 0.1 version I installed does not have that ability.

Hi !

There should be an entry in the contact list for the "preferred language": this
would enable an application which would access the contact list to retrieve an
email address to send automatically the email in the right language.
Explanation: I have in mind an application which should automatically send a
mail to some of your contacts, and being able to know which language to use is a
definite plus. So there should be a hook te retrieve this.

Yeah, eventually we'll want to have to-only and cc-only rules, but for
now, people are mostly using this for "put mail to this mailing list
in this folder", so we pretty much all wanted to-or-cc all the time.

0.1 does have the ability to send mail actually. Even 0.0 did. If you
can't send mail, then you probably have some sort of
compile/installation problem.

OK, so I just spent a few hours downloading and compiling Evolution and
related utilities from CVS on a woody system, and it's looking pretty
slick compared to 0.0 (the last version I tried). However, I have a
question.

I chose to import my ~/mbox file, which was in and of itself pretty
stupid, since I know it's not all stable yet. However, what i didn't
realize was that, upon checking my mail, it would remove all mail from
~/mbox. OK, I'll just copy the mailbox Evolution creates back to ~/,
right? Well, the mbox file Evolution made looks normal, but neither mutt
nor mailx can load it. So I'm a bit stuck. Is there a way to make this a
standard mbox file again, short of forwarding myself all the mail? Also,
shouldn't be there a way to prevent the clearing behaviour in the first
place? Not that I don't mind using Evolution to read my old mail, but
I'm a bit wary of using a pre-alpha program for that.

Oh yes, and apologies if this message comes across odd-looking, it's my
first attempt at sending mail with Evo.

It is a standard mbox.  Some mailers are just particular about what
they think is standard (i.e. there is no standard?).

You just have to make the From lines (any line beggining
with exactly "From " in the mailbox) be something like

From user@host.domain Thu Jul  8 22:30:12 2000

Rather than the From - that evolution uses.

Yes, you point it at a copy of your mailbox, not the real one. :)

Evolution incorporates mail so it can index and filter and control
access to its mailboxes better.

Looks ok in elm!

Something like the following might help:

formail -i "From " -s formail <mbox >mbox.new

The -i "From " thing makes it remove the "From " line and
sending it through formail again makes it add in another one
based on other headers.

evolution, I get this message:

Unable to get folder file:///home/ujwal/evolution/local/Inbox: No store =

The evolution directory got created OK, and there is an mbox file under =
evolution/local/Inbox
The same thing happens when I try to open the Outbox or Trash.

Also, when I choose "Mail Configuration" under Tools, the evolution-mail =
process crashes.

Can anybod help?

Thanks,

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution 0.2 "Saccharomyces" is released

Dear lifeforms,

Our tireless team of dancing primates has assembled version 0.2 of the
Evolution groupware suite (codename "Saccharomyces").

Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, and addressbook application.
This release incorporates many new features and bug fixes since the 
previous version.

* Availability:

  You can get the Evolution 0.2 tarball here:

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/evolution

  Evolution also requires a new version of GtkHTML (0.5), Bonobo
  (0.15), GNOME Print (0.20), OAF (0.5) and ORBit (0.5.2).  These
  packages are available from:

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources

* Changes in this version:

        Shell:
        
          * Folder selection dialog (Ettore).
        
          * Folder creation dialog (Ettore).
        
        Addressbook:
        
          * LDAP server configuration dialog (Chris Toshok).
          
          * Integration of LDAP servers in the shell's tree view
            (Chris Toshok).
          
          * ETable-based view (Chris Lahey).
          
          * Printing support for the ETable-based view (Chris Lahey).
          
          * Address selection dialog integrated with the message
            composer (Chris Lahey).
          
          * Many miscellaneous bugs fixed (everyone).
        
        
        Calendar:
        
          * Printing support (Michael, Federico).
          
          * Many, many behavior fixes and polishing to the
            day/week/month view widgets (Damon).
          
          * New glade-based event editor.  This is unfinished but
            usable (Seth, Federico).
          
          * Mouse wheel scrolling support (Anders).
          
          * We have an awesome new engine for computing recurring
            events (Damon).  This will be plugged in to the new
            iCalendar code.
          
          * Internal and public API fixes (Federico, Seth).
          
          * Shell-related changes (Ettore).
          
          * Data model for ETable; this is not used yet (Federico).
          
          * New iCalendar support; this is not used yet (Federico).
          
          * Pilot syncing updates; this is not used yet (Seth).
          
          * Many miscellaneous bugs fixed (everyone).
        
        Mailer:
        
          Major features:
        
          * Basic IMAP support (Jeff)
        
          * Threaded message view (Michael, Chris Toshok)
        
          * Filters now work (original work by Michael, bugfixes by
            Dan)
        
          Smaller features:
        
          * Implemented moving messages between folders (Dan)
        
          * Very basic printing support (Dan, but it was only like 5
            lines of code, because gnome-print kicks ass)
        
          * "Delete", "Forward", and "Refile" operations now work on
            multiple messages. (Chris Lahey, Peter Williams, Dan)
        
          * Toggle read/unread flag when the user clicks on the
            envelope icon (Chris Lahey, Dan).
        
          * The "New folder" menu item now works (Ettore, Dan).
        
          * The filter/vfolder druid now uses the new shell folder
            selection UI (Michael)
        
          * Added "Cc" to the set of filter/vfolderable headers and
            make the filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule work
            with to or cc.  (Dan)
        
          * New key bindings: "Delete" deletes the current message and
            jumps to the next undeleted message. "N" and "P" go to
            next/previous unread message. (Dan)
        
          * Keep asking for POP/IMAP password until the user gets it
            correct or hits Cancel, and remember the result until the
            user exits (or chooses "Forget Passwords"). (Dan, Jeff)
        
          * Kludge Camel to output ISO-8859-1 instead of UTF-8, since
            neither GtkHTML nor ETable supports UTF-8 still. (Dan)
        
          * Use the gnome-vfs "sniff buffer" interface to try to
            identify the MIME type of attachments without useful type
            information (Dan)
        
          * Allow saving drafts in the composer (Ettore)
        
          * Added "Received date" header to the set of possible
            message list headers. (Dan)
        
          * Partial gladification of the config dialog (JP Rosevear)
        
          Bug fixes:
        
          * Message read/unread/deleted flags should now be saved
            reliably when you exit, and summary should not be rebuilt
            when a rebuild isn't needed. Expunging should work
            reliably (Dan, Ettore, Jeff).
        
          * Fix disappearing toolbar bug (Dan).
        
          * Fixed a bug that made downloading of very large messages
            over POP incredibly slow, and various other smaller POP
            bugs. (Dan)
        
          * Fixed bugs that made large attachments sometimes get
            dropped and small ones sometimes get truncated. (Dan)
        
          * Fixed filter/vfolder "messages to address" rule to
            correctly match "to" rather than "from". (Michael)
        
          * Fix some text/plain formatting bugs in the composer. (Dan,
            Ettore)
        
          * Turn off search mode when getting new mail (to avoid
            corrupting the display). Make "get mail" always put
            unfiltered mail into Inbox rather than the current
            folder. (Dan)
        
          * Fixed a bug that caused "Re:" to be prepended even to
            subjects that started with "Re:" when replying. Added a
            default subject to forwarded messages. (Dan)
        
          * Make the "Attach" dialog in the composer remember the last
            directory it was in. (Dan)
        
          * Code to parse invalid date formats since some mailers
            generate them... (Jeff)
        
          * Fixed various small SMTP bugs (Jeff, Chris Lahey)
        
          * Fixed some memory leaks (Peter, Jeff)
        
          * Make replies use the text/plain part of a
            multipart/alternative if the user configured plain text
            rather than HTML mail sending.  (Dan)
        
          * Various config dialog fixes (Jeff)
        
          * Partial filter/vfolder GUI facelift (Jacob)

Please note that this is still software in development and should not
be used for production work.  We appreciate testers and contributors;
you'll be in our hearts forever, but please remember that Evolution
will still be buggy, incomplete, and temperamental.

Thanks to the many people who have sent in suggestions and fixes.

(And of course, this announcement was sent with Evolution. :-))

Enjoy,

  The Evolution team

Subject: [Evolution] problem w/ gnome-vfs 0.2

    Hi all, I'm sorry if this is inappropriate for this group, but I
think I have everything working to compile evolution but gnome-vfs 0.2
I've tried both an ftp.gnome.org tarball and a cvs update and neither
will compile.  Here's the problem w/ the tarball:

 gcc -g -O2 -Wall -Wunused -Wall -Wno-uninitialized -Wchar-subscripts

any ideas on what to do?  I'm using oaf-0.3 b/c oaf-0.4 won't compile
with my ORBit 0.5.1.   I'm excited to get this working, but I'm not
quite sure what's wrong.  Thanks in advance,

I think you need orbit 0.5.2, you need the latest oaf, definetly.

You need the latest OAF and the latest ORBit (from the stable 0.5.x 
branch) - I think the latest is 0.5.2

If you can not compile ORBit, then that is your problem (but you have 
provided no info on that compile error so we can not help).

Ali

I got several linking errors like:

gconf-client.o(.text+0xb97): undefined reference to `gconf_listeners_new'
gconf-client.o(.text+0xbc4): undefined reference to `gconf_listeners_add'

I fixed this by swapping the -lgconf and -lgconf-gtk, as they were in the
wrong order.

Subject: [Evolution] Building OAF

Hi all !
Just trying to compile the packages I need to get Evolution running,
and
I've been halted at oaf.
When running 'make' I eventually get this:

make[2]: Entering directory `/home/jedi/src/Evolution/oaf-0.4.0/oafd'
yacc -d -v ./ac-query-parse.y
make[2]: yacc: Command not found
make[2]: *** [stamp-parser] Error 127
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/jedi/src/Evolution/oaf-0.4.0/oafd'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/jedi/src/Evolution/oaf-0.4.0'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

Any ideas how I can get it to build ?

Cheers !

Paul,

Looks like you need to install yacc (in /usr/bin on my Redhat 6.1 box).
Don't know which package this is part of, since the Redhat installer
does all that for me.

$ rpm -qf /usr/bin/yacc
byacc-1.9-12

Although why it isn't using bison instead is beyond me (i suspect
it can use either, but dont quote me on that).

Hi there,

I have been trying in vane to compile both evolution 0.1 and now also
0.2

If anyone could offer some advice/suggestions I would greatly
appreciate it!!

e-shell.h:32: gconf/gconf-client.h: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [e-component-registry.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/kschar/gnome/evolution-0.2/shell'
make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/kschar/gnome/evolution-0.2/shell'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/kschar/gnome/evolution-0.2'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

I always seem to receive these type of errors and I don't now that much about compiling "YET" but if someone could help me figure this out I would be grateful! Thanks!
 
  Ken

P.S. If you need more info please let me know - I'll be glad to provide it!

Looks like you need the gconf package as well.

Ok, so I have ORBit-0.5.2, but oaf-0.4 won't build, here's my error with
this.  How do I turn this error back into an error and not a warning that
makes the compiler exit?  Thanks again

Subject: [Evolution] GConf install errors

Hi there,

Trying to get evolution to compile let me to find out that I needed to
install GConf.  Soooo - I configured & made GConf with no errors however
when I try to do a make install I receive the following error.

Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

	Thanks, that fixed everything, still wasn't trivial to get
	evolution running
	but I think it's working now (we'll see if this message gets
	through).  
	preview release 3 looks pretty neat, I'm excited for this

Hello,

I am trying to install the gconf cvs packages and am running into the

I have installed all the packages off of the Evolution webpage except
for Evolution itself as gconf seems to be required to do so.

Subject: [Evolution] Indication of unread messages

The latest version of Evolution is excellent; well done!  It's very
close to the stage where I'd consider it as my default mail reader.

But one facility which I consider essential is some form of indication
of the number of unread mail items in a folder - or even just an
indication that there is unread mail in a folder. Is this planned?

Yup. It nearly made it into 0.2... it may be working in the CVS
versions within the next week. (We're all annoyed by the lack of that
feature too... with lots of filters, it turns into a game to find
where your mail ended up when when you fetch it :)

Subject: [Evolution] turning error warnings into ignored warnings?

Sometimes I can't compile something because all of the warnings are treated as
errors and it exits. I want the warnings to be treated as regular warnings and
not errors. This is what I usually get:

cc1: warnings being treated as errors

I know theres is a configure option for this, I just don't know what it is.

I've gotten this with gnome-vfs in the past but I can't remember how I solved
it.
Now I've actually gotten to the point where I want to compile Evolution or
Nautilus. But it treats all my warnings as errors.

Thanks,
Tony

If you configure gnome-vfs (or oaf) with "--disable-more-warnings", it
won't do that.

As far as I know, gnome-vfs and oaf are the only package Evolution
depends on that behaves that way.

You should make sure that the things it's complaining about aren't
caused by you trying to build them against the wrong versions of their
prerequisite libraries though.

Hello,

I had that problem earlier, when I recompiled everything and specified the
--prefix and --sysconfdir directives to ./configure, setting them
appropriatly the problem went away.  I was using ./configure --prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc

Most of the packages needed those flags set so evolution could find them

Hope this helps

Dan

 Download Gconf 0.5. It is a must even though not given on helix's site.

 And, yes it is ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/unstable/sources/GConf/

Ok, so I got some help from fejj on irg.gnome.org in #evolution and he suggested that I set ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/share/aclocal"

but then when running sh autogen.sh I got the errors in bonoboerrout (attached)

so he suggested i get oaf, whose readme says that you have to have the latest orbit. so I got the latest orbit and

trying the sh autogen.sh there, I got the errors in errout (attached).

I really want to help, but I can't get anything to compile. I have gcc 2.95.2 and I have the latest helix gnome stuff.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what's wrong?

I also picked up the src of gnome-libs and ompiled them, and that went fine. But it didn't help anything else...

thank you in advance!

This suggestion is a shot in the dark, but it's easy to try. :-)

My theory:

The various Gnome RPMs are installed under /usr , but the default when
you run configure (or autogen.sh, which runs configure for you) is to
put things under /usr/local .  So Bonobo, ORBit, etc., are going to wind
up installing under /usr/local and (I assume) looking for support files
there as well.

So, try running autogen.sh --prefix=/usr instead of just autogen.sh;
this should cause all the code you're compiling to install under /usr
and look for support files there.

Best of luck,

Nathan

Subject: [Evolution] Crash on startup with OAFD error

Hello,

I am trying to run Evolution 0.2 on a Linux Mandrake 7.1 system,
building RPMs of all the packages apart from GConf (no spec file). After
installing everything I tried running evolution, and this error message
came up:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b.
(Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

I set OAF_INFO_PATH to /usr/share/oaf; if OAF_INFO_PATH is not set the
only difference is that 'trying /usr/share/oaf/' appears before the
warning.

Any help appreciated,

Michel

Have a look at /tmp/orbit-XXXXX where XXXXX is your username. Deleting it
should work because it seems that once you have started the program with a
wrong OAF_INFO_PATH, it keeps the configuration there. 

In my case, deleting the full /tmp/orbit-ctalon, and setting the OAF_INFO_
PATH to /usr/share/oaf worked ok, although I had to start evolution a couple of
times again in order to have the menus working.

BTW, this is on a debian dist, but I don't thing there should be differences
there.

No thats not quite correct during the autoconf stage (it is when
compiling), aclocal looks for macros in the default place where
it was installed, which is /usr/share/aclocal, and that is the
problem it is having.

I think he's missing the libtool macros, which probably means
he's missing (or maybe out of date) libtool (or alternatively,
auto* can't find it), try searching for libtool.m4, that is
where that macro is defined.

Phooey.  I thought that might not pan out.   Thanks for correcting me.

Subject: [Evolution] RPMs ?

Hi all,

First of all, I'd like to thank HelixCode for the whole great work
that's being done around Gnome. It will definitly help Linux penetrate
the end/windows user public.

I also was wondering if s.o. had been kind enough to build rpms of
evolution 0.2 and needed librairies.

Thx.

/tmp/evolution-0.2/mail/main.c:79: undefined reference to `gconf_init'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[2]: *** [evolution-mail] Error 1

make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/evolution-0.2'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

it's weird, 'cause as far as i know it can find the gconf.h where
gconf_init is initialized. 
any ideas?

I have installed all the required packages and they all compiled without 
any trouble, i'm not very experienced with compiling but I would really 
like to get this working... I hate evolution 0.1 working but no luck 
with this release.
Any pointers would be appreciated

Thanks in advance

Kyle

 Download Gconf 0.5. It is a must even though not given on helix's site.

 And, yes it is ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/unstable/sources/GConf/

Subject: [Evolution] Can't send mail and buttons disappear.

I have Evolution 0.2 installed fine however when I try to reply or 
compose mail the main window goes blank and all the buttons in the 
button bar disappear.  Anyone have any ideas?  

I also had the old 
problem of looking at something in the address book or calendar 
(can't remember) and then not being able to open the Inbox again 
because "A view already exists".

The only thing I didn't compile was bonobo-0.15 because I already 
had that from the 0.1 try at Evolution.

Very nice work by the way.

You can also set the ACLOCAL_FLAGS variable to additional paths, ie:

ACLOCAL_FLAGS=-I /opt/gnome/share/aclocal

I do this in /etc/profile or you could do it in your local shell setup.

Hi 

great product, btw ;-)

Evolution v0.2 (d/l it from cvs 4 h ago)

My system: i586-pc-linux-gnu
latest helix rpms
bonobo 0.15
gnome-print 0.20
gnome-vfs 0.2
gtkhtml 0.5
libunicode 0.4
oaf 0.4.0

If you click on Tools -> Mail configuration -> Sources -> select an
existing pop3 account -> Edit, then mail source type is set to IMAPv4

If you then change to POP3, username and server fields are resetted,
this behaviour should be changed (in my opinion :-))

Perhaps you could also add an Option on the "New Message" window to
change from HTML mails to plain text mails.

If i enable vfolders and click on outbox/drafts/trash, i get a message:
Unable to get folder filer:///home/wingman/evolution/local/Drafts:
Folder '/mbox' does not exist. If i create e.g. file
/home/wingman/evolution/local/Drafts/mbox i get no error.

Next thing, perhaps you could change the behaviour of the "End" key in
new mails. If i press it, the cursor jumps down to the end of the mail
and not to the end of the line. 

I also got some segfaults, if i close evolution, but i couldnt
reproduce it. (Shouldnt there be any core files in my home?)

Ok, thats all for now :-)

Yes, the defaults go missing when you go back to the configuration - the
information should still be saved and work though.  This will be fixed
shortly.

I had a similar problem. I think that the spec file for generating RPM is the
cause of this problem because no oainfo files where copied into /usr/share/oaf
for me.

So i made a manual copy of
./mail/evolution-mail.oafinfo
./addressbook/gui/component/addressbook.oafinfo
./addressbook/gui/component/select-names/evolution-addressbook-select-names.oafinfo
./calendar/gui/calendar-control.oafinfo
./calendar/gui/evolution-calendar.oafinfo
./wombat/wombat.oafinfo

and now i can launch evolution but i have a crash when i try to access my
inbox
"Unable to get folder file://home/light/evolution/local/Inbox: No store
available for protocol 'mbox'"

Any help appreciated,
Jean-Michel

Subject: [Evolution] Problems compiling Evolution-0.2

Hi there,

I "thought" I had now met all the reqs to compile evolution properly but
I'm still having a problem.

This is the latest error - any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

Thanks!
  Ken

Get gconf-0.5 from ftp.gnome.org and install.  That ought to take care of
it.

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, I've already done that but I'm
still receiving the errors :-(   The same errors.

I also noticed this when running ./configure --prefix=/usr
--sysconfdir=/etc

checking for gnome-config... (cached) /usr/bin/gnome-config
checking for xmlNewDoc in -lxml... (cached) yes
checking if Bonobo uses OAF... yes
checking for oaf-config... (cached) /usr/bin/oaf-config
checking for gconf-config... (cached) no
checking for GCONF - version >= 0.5.0... no
*** The gconf-config script installed by GCONF could not be found
*** If GCONF was installed in PREFIX, make sure PREFIX/bin is in
*** your path, or set the GCONF_CONFIG environment variable to the
*** full path to gconf-config.

However, I've tried adding this to the path with no success.

Any other suggestions/tips that your willing to offer would be gratefully
received :-)

Thanks!
  Ken

did you install gconf in /usr ??
maybe it's installed in /usr/local
install gconf with --prefix=/usr

Hi Ken,

This may be the culprit:
checking for gconf-config... (cached) no
                              ^^^^^^

The fact that gconf-config is not found appears to cached (in
config.cache), so, rm config.cache, and rerun ./configure.

config.cache is created by configure script when it runs, if it doesn't
exist.  Next time you run configure, it uses cached data.  So, remove it,
that will force it to re-create the config.cache file, and (hopefully),
find gconf-config.  Also, make sure that gconf-config is in the $PATH of
the shell that executes configure.

Good luck,

-Mark

Hello,

There are now Evolution 0.2 RPMS available for Red Hat Linux.


They can be installed via helix-update.  When presented with the
mirror list, choose the "Evolution Preview" mirror.

There are two updates available: one containing the packages needed to
run evolution, and one containing the development packages needed to
compile the evolution tarball.


Alternatively, you can manually download the packages from:
ftp://ftp.helixcode.com/helix/evolution/distributions/RedHat-6/

or rebuild the SRPMS from:
ftp://ftp.helixcode.com/helix/evolution/distributions/RedHat-6/SRPMS/


We will be updating these when there new releases of Evolution are
made.

As always, please keep in mind that Evolution is in development and
will lose your mail.

Thanks,
Jacob & Ettore

Hello!

  I  don't  know  better  email  address for  getting  help  about  my
problem running evolution (0.2).
  - I've read the README
  - I've got helix gnome (debian packages)
  - I've installed all the remaining packages (into /opt/evolution)
  - I copied /opt/evolution/lib/*.sh /usr/lib
  - I     set    GNOME_PATH     (to    /usr),     OAF_INFO_PATH    (to
  /opt/evolution/share/oaf)

  The  Problem:  evolution  compiles,  but  when I  want  to  run,  it
crashes.

Gdk-WARNING **: shmget failed!

evolution-shell-WARNING    **:    Could   not    activate    component
evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail.  (Maybe  you   need  to  set
OAF_INFO_PATH?)

It seems to be an oaf problem.

Could you help  me solving this problem or forwarding to  this mail to
the proper person or mailing list?

Regards,

dLux

I would suggest the 'shmget()' failed is a clue.  Does the
system have SysV IPC support in the kernel?  Not sure which
comnponent uses it, whether its orbit, or oaf, etc.

Well, I have done all of the suggestions I've read so far, but I still get the OAF error, as well as a camel-ERROR.  I have set the OAF_INFO_PATH to /usr/share/oaf, copied over all the files, and I even deleted the /tmp/orbit-xxxx files.  No luck!  Any help would be appreciated.

camel-ERROR **: Could not open camel provider directory: No such file or directory

Hey, would you consider putting up a Nautilus-test mirror one of these days?
It's really hard to compile and keep up with all the sources, being so many. 
And thanks a lot for the Evolution 0.2 one =)

One more question.. Whatcha know about GNOME 1.4 or a 2.0beta1 version?

Alas, it does not work for me. I deleted all the files in /tmp/orbit-michel that
contained 'oaf' or 'OAF' in their names, and killed any active oafd - did not work.
So I proceeded to repeat again, this time removing the entire /tmp/orbit-michel;
did not make any different. Still the same error message...

Does OAF need to be compiled with any specific flags?

Thanks,

Michel

 Did you compile it as all other packages with the same --prefix and 
--sysconfdir as the rest of your gnome packages?

 You can obtain those by doing:
 gnome-config --prefix
 gnome-config --sysconfdir

 Thanks a lot. I could compile it, but prefer rpms anytime. Easier to 
track dependencies and such. The usual hype in other words ;)

 Anyway, I agree with the other poster, adding Nautilus would be a great 
idea.

 Maybe I should forward this to nautilus-list? I'll do it.

I suspect this is a sign of a deeper problem, but you will probably find 
that when make gets to to 'mail' it fails to include ``-lgconf -gconf-gtk''
in the list of libs... 

I hacked around this by correcting the make file, but evol segv's for me
due to gnome-split-install-fuckage.  I'm not sure if you will have this 
problem as well, but you can find out by editing the mail/Makefile and 
added the libs.

Subject: [Evolution] Gnome Print CVS status.

Hello guys,

   We might have not communicated this previously, but people are
running into problems because they are using gnome-print from CVS
HEAD.

   Lauris and I will be working on cleaning up massively gnome-print
in the next few weeks: we expect major API changes to be done in this
time.  Binary and source incompatible changes are being made to the
code right now in the HEAD branch. 

   If you need gnome-print, the official position right now is "use

   We do not have an estimate yet on when those changes will start to
stabilize, but we will try to keep people informed as the new code
base matures.

Looks like you either (a) didn't build gtkhtml with bonobo support, or
(b) didn't build gtkhtml with oaf support. Either one would imply that
either you built the packages "out of order" (see Evolution's README
for an order that should work), or you installed something into a
non-default prefix and then didn't set GNOME_PATH when configuring the
later bits.

That means that at run time the mailer can't find the shared libraries
in the directory that it thinks you installed into (and thus won't
run, thus causing the shell error you also quoted, which is suggesting
that maybe you have an oaf problem, but it's wrong). Did you do
something weird with changing prefixes between configure time and
install time?

Thinking about this, I realized that all of the other packages installed into /usr, and evolution installed into /usr/local.  So I did a 'make uninstall' and then reinstalled with 'make install PREFIX=/usr' .  I no longer receive the camel error, but I still get the OAF error:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

Any other ideas?  OAF seemed to compile and install correctly.

I have a really good suggestion which I am actually stealing from Owen 
Taylor and his 'pango' project :)

Create RPMs using a different name than the standard i.e. gnome-vfs-ev, 
bonobo-ev, etc.

Also make sure they do not install in /usr (perhaps they should install 
in a /evolution directory or something). That way this will not 'clobber' 
different installations just for trying to play with Evolution (for 
example, I am hacking on gnome-vfs, I don't want to install a gnome-vfs 
RPM that will screw up my hacking/testing).

People may also need to run different RPMs for different packages.

Anyway - the way pango does it is install 'gtk+-gtkss' into /opt/pango or 
something like that. That way it does not clobber the Gtk+ RPM and it 
does not install files where they will get in the way.

Regards,
Ali

Hey - Thanks. 

I really want to keep up with the play on Evolution, do a little
testing, mail scren shots to my Windows buddies etc.  I habe Evolution 0
and 0.1, and even went as far as downloading the source...  But I am
into the idea of rpm's at the moment having recently rebuilt my entire
system.

   GNOME_PRINT_0_20 is the latest tag.

All good and well, except that 0.20 has a serious bug affecting
people who distribute precompiled packages: fonts are searched
for at configure time, not install time.

I've been trying to get these packages as described, however, when I try to I

Subject: [Evolution] No Tools Menu in Evolution 0.2

Hi there,

I just installed Evolution Preview 0.2 rpms and noticed that there is no
tools menu nor is there an actions menu (though I am not quite sure
wether the last is supposed to be there).

I already observed that when compiling evolution from source the last
few times, but always assumed its related to my screwed up system. The
start up log from evolution, which is attached below shows three
bonobo-criticals which - I think - might cause the problem.

Any help would be apriciated. Thanks in advance.

Hi,

Try to define a mail account, and then restart Evolution. The menus should be
now there.

That does not work at all. Did you do anything special (like deleting 
~/evolution)?

When we start doing Nautilus releases, we'll definitely be doing packages
(RPMs), and not just source tarballs. But we haven't done our first Nautilus
release yet.

 I know there is no nautilus release yet, but it would
be a good idea in my humble opinion to do preview
releases a la Helix Code's evolution.

 It's like evolution is really usable yet anyway, but
it might help you have some user feedback as to where
to head in terms of features and such.

 For evolution, I am "compiling" a list of things I
don't like and others I like.

 And anything would probably be better than current
gmc. Heck, I hate those $HOME/.gnome-desktop/.....
cache stuff that appears even when you open trashcan.
Stupid things like dragging a file to desktop to
create links is non existant, but instead you need to
fill in full path of the damned destination.

 Anyway, I'll stop whining about gmc, but promise to
be there for its official burial ceremony.

Binary RPMs rock. I tried downloading source tarballs and while with
worked for me for the 0.1 release, doing the same with the 0.2 release
hosed my system. Took a fair while manually deleting dodgy libraries and
stuff to get a working gnome again. At least with RPMs you can easily
uninstall!

BTW, Im running evolution 0.2 (using the binary RPMS) and noticed that
the calendar and addressbook icons don't do anything. Is this a bug, or
are these just not implemented yet? Seems to send and receive mail OK,
and filters work for me, but I get seemingly random crashes when doing
things like creating new folders, and entering email settings.

Yes.

However, you may need to edit ~/evolution/config by hand and append a
path to the imap: URL there, to tell the provider where your mail
folders are relative to the default directory it puts you in.

Hello, 

I just started using Evolution 0.2, and I was wondering if you will be
implementing the ablilty to run filters on mail that has already been
received, ie your inbox.  The reason I'm wondering is that I just got
all my mail from the server and realized I didn't implement any of the
filters yet so I had to sort the mail by hand.

Thanks

Subject: [Evolution] IMAP feedback in 0.2

Hey.

Just downloaded and installed Evolution 0.2.... this thing is AWESOME!

Anyway.  I pointed it at my IMAP server that I have been using for 2
years under Netscape Mail.

From a protocol standpoint it worked PERFECTLY.

The implementation just doesn't seem there yet.

- Evolution is currently using INBOX as the default folder.  Usually
this set to the DEFAULT folder.  So it isn't really ever shown.

- The full path is always displayed :(  So instead of a Tree/Folder view
it is flat and then the full hierarchy is displayed.  So the following:

INBOX.lists.evolution@helixcode_com 

should really be this way IMO  It should be

<SERVER_NAME>
  - lists
    - evolution@helixcode_com

:)

- Retrieving messages doesn't work :(.  If I select one of these folders
nothing happens.  It can't be used in its current format like this :(

Anyway... keep up the good work :)

Kevin

Hi Dan,

That's what a 'VFolder' or virtual folder is.  If you go to
'Tools->Virtual Folder Druid', it will
allow you to create a virtual folder.  The way that works is, you can
set up your filter criteria, 
and give it a name.  It will appear in the Vfolders branch of the
Folders tree.  (If you don't
see the Folders tree, click 'View->Show Folder Bar' checkbox.)  Then,
when you click on the
VFolder by name, it will automatically apply that filter to your
Inbox.  I think that's what you
want to do, yes?

Have a good one,

-Mark

--I agree. Excellent work!  I'm using IMAPv4 so not sure if these errors also
occur under POP3 or not. I've tried 4 or 5 times search 'Body or Subject
Contains' and it's bombed each time.  

--First time I used it it didn't exihbit the following behavior but now it does.
Clicking Delete will not draw a cross line until I move to another message.
However, if I hit the Delete Key it works fine draws a line through the message.

Still can't figure out when hitting Delete Key where exactly does it skip to
next? Based on from, subject, time, thread...I can't figure it out for the life
of me.  It'll go to messages I've marked deleted, or new ones, etc. Help.

--Request:  I like how when scrolling down a message body that doesn't fit
within the screen it'll keep the focus & continue to highlight the message so
one can hit the UP/DOWN arrow or DELETE key.  How about having PageUp and
PageDown keys to move through the body of the messages rather than having to
resort to the mouse to scroll up & down through a long message.  Perhaps
CTRL-PageUp and CTRL-PageDown would scroll a 5 or 10 or whatever messages
through the list view. This would speed up reading significantly avoiding the
dreaded mouse.

Or if the PageUp/Down keys are going to be for something else how about using
the left & right arrow keys.

--Currently is the timeout 5 seconds for having the focus on a message before it
is marked read? 

--When attempting to expunge messages from IMAP account it shows an unknown
error.  I'm logging ALL INFO on the IMAP server and don't see a thing.  Is it
even attempting to?  Or is it yet to be implemented?

--When I was REPLYING it wouldn't wrap the text and far right side the end
wouldn't show any text.  So I typed the remaining text which I thought it didn't
take (since it didn't display it) and BCC'd myself and it actually did take the
input. Weird. I just tried this in COMPOSE and it did wrap text so go figure.

--Refile a message to Trash folder it says unable to create the folder even
though it's already created.  Refile a message to a Local folder doesn't work
either. Error couldn't retrieve message 1219 from imap server. POP users does
Refiling work for you?

Yes vfolders can be used to do something similar, but its not quite
the same.  And yes, we plan to implement this feature, like 'apply filters
to folder xxxx now'.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Ok, I set my ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/share/aclocal" and I moved the libtool.m4 there by hand after compiling and

installing libtool.

Now, when I try to compile ORBit, I get these errors: see attached orberr file...

And when trying to compile bonobo, I get these errors: see bonoerr file...

Basically, I'm getting a million duplicated macro errors.

I really want to get the project to compile so that I can try to contribute. But I'm not familiar with the workings of

autogen and configure scripts and macros... If someone can help me get over this initial step, I'd really appreciate it.

thanks again...

Subject: [Evolution] several annoyances

Hi,
	Evolution looks good, but that's about as much as I can say.
I installed the rpms for my RH6 6.2 system and ran into a few problems:
I am using my local mbox to access mail.

1. Can you / will you be able to import mail from Pine in a simple manner?
(I just copied stored mail to mbox) 
2. The Tools and Actions menus (I think they are called, I have the
Swedish menus) have no contents.
3. Deleted mail is not deleted.

Cheers,
	Bo

Try without the -I /usr/share/aclocal, it should look there by default?

Otherwise, its because you ahve some duplciajted m4 files - remove the
older versions.  It'll only work if you only have 1 of each file
basically.

On my IMAP server, mailboxes are in ~user/Mail/
When I add the source, and restart Evolution, the Folder view gives:
- Mailserver
  - Mailbox1
  - Mailbox2
  ...
However, when I click on Mailbox1, it doesn't open, and on the stderr/stdout
screen I get: cannot open /Mailbox1.

If I change ~/evolution/config to read imap://server/Mail/, the Folder
view gives:
- Mailserver
  - INBOX
and nothing else.  Looks like it tries the wrong directory.

Subject: [Evolution] Trouble with rpms.

Hi all,

Please help - if you can :-)   I am running a RH 6.2 system with the
2.2.16 kernel.  I've downloaded the rpms using helix-gnome updater (the
updated ones that are out now 0.2-1) and when I try to start evolution. If
it's the first time it creates the folders then crashed. After that each
time I try to start it it just crashed with the following error output to
the term.

[kschar@scharknet kschar]$ evolution

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b. (Maybe
you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

ANY help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I'd really like to
see evolution running. It's got/will have all that I'm looking for
(e-mail, contact manager, etc.)

Thank-you very much!!
  Ken

Hi there,

I'm receiving the same OAF errors.


evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751d6d1b. (Maybe

ANY suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution Preview 2

Using helix-update, I downloaded Evolution Preview 2 and installed it. 

However, any attempts to run it result in evolution simply
hanging. Eventually it fails to respond to the SaveYourself command and I
kill it off.

I'm using RH6.2. Any ideas?

Thanks.

We are going to have import facilities from the most common format by

I believe this is a Bonobo bug. I have similiar problems when the
selected locale is Italian. I am Cc:ing Michael Meeks the GnomeUIInfo
master so that maybe he can help.

Tools/Expunge would do it... :-/

As a workaround try to use the default locale.

This error will also come up if the mail component is run
successfully, but crashes before registering with OAF. We'd need to
see the whole debugging output to know for sure what happened.

This means you have something in ~/evolution which is not what
Evolution is expecting... did you unpack your source tree there?

If you rename ~/evolution to something different and start it up
again, it should work.

It looks like an ETable updating bug.  Chris?

I'll check this out.

Space/Backspace do this in 0.2. I think PgUp/PgDown should be used for
scrolling the message list.

Yeah, something like that. I don't like that feature myself but we have
not come to an agreement as to how this should work yet. :-)

If you use a PRE paragraph, it does not get formatted (that's the way
HTML works). But actually, horizontal scrolling is currently broken in
GtkHTML, so that's why you don't see any text when typing.

I think that Refiling just does not work with IMAP yet. Jeff?

The IMAP provider doesn't support searching yet, and unfortunately, in
0.2, we forgot to disable it from the gui. So yes, it will crash if
you try. "Don't do that then." :)

Yup. There were some bugs with signals not being emitted which have
been fixed now in CVS.

It should always skip to the next undeleted message. If you've sorted
the message list by one of the columns though, it will appear to
behave randomly. It shouldn't ever go to messages marked deleted
though... Anyway, this code is being rototilled a bit, so hopefully it
will be fixed in 0.3.

Try Space/Backspace. :)

> message before it is marked read?

Heh. No, 1.5 seconds. It will be configurable later. (Maybe in 0.3)

The IMAP code is pretty new, and I think that was left disabled to
keep people from losing mail. (I'm not sure though.)

> --Refile a message to Trash folder it says unable to create the folder even

Oops. Yeah, the default folders are probably slightly broken. If you
create a new folder (File -> New Folder), you'll be able to refile
into that.

Does this happen if you switch to the default locale too?

It sounds like a Bonobo bug to me.

Subject: [Evolution] evolution packages for Debian

I have built some Debian packages for Evolution and its dependencies,
and am releasing them in the hopes that someone out there will find
them useful.

These aren't of nearly the same quality as the Helix GNOME debs. There
are some known minor packaging issues, but things appear to work
fine. Keep in mind that all the packages involved are in a prerelease
state.

In particular, the gconf deb runs a program in its postinstall script
that requires oaf. This starts oafd, which remains running after the
install is finished. Feel free to kill this root-owned oafd after the
install is over. I don't know a good way to handle this problem, since
root could be running some programs that require oafd to be
running. That rules out killing it off in the postinst. I'll look into
things to see what can be done.

These have been built and tested under Woody, though they should work
on Potato as well. As with the Helix GNOME debs, I consider any
failure to work on Potato to be a bug. Please file a bug report if you
see any problems of that sort. ( http://bugs.helixcode.com/ )

These have been built for the i386 architecture - that's the only
machine I have available at the moment. Source packages are provided,
though.

The appropriate apt line is:
deb http://spidermonkey.helixcode.com/evolution/distributions/Debian ./

Share and enjoy.

Peter

Hi Dan,

Is this the debugging output that you mean?  Thanks for your help. I'm
anxious to get evolution going - all I've seen so far is screen shots on
the web :-(

SeeYA!

This has been fixed in the latest CVS, the reason it crashed was because
your IMAP provider probably didn't support SEARCHing, in this case
Evolution will now grey-out the search tool so you can't use it (eventually
we might code some sort of work-around so you can search on IMAP even if it
doesn't support SEARCH).

This has also been fixed in the latest CVS. I had forgotten to have IMAP
signal that a message/folder has changed so it was never updated in the
GUI. There was also one location in the mbox code that needed to have the
signals added, so I fixed that too.

I'm not sure :-)
I think this selection is based on how e-table widget handles it, and to
know for sure I'd have to ask Chris Lahey who isn't currently here.

I believe we have plans to attach key accelerators to as much as we
possibly can, and also have them configurable.

The current timeout is set to 1.5 seconds, we also plan to have this
configurable by 1.0

Expunge currently does send the EXPUNGE command to the IMAP server, but I
have commented out the code that marks messages as deleted, so expunge
won't actually do a whole lot :-)
I did this to protect beta testers from accidently deleting their mail :-)

The reason for this is because all text wrapped in the <PRE> html tag does
not get wrapped (all replied text is wrapped in <PRE>)

I have fixed this problem in CVS as well, the problem was that the current
state of the IMAP server wasn't correct.

No. Everything is fine when switching to the default locale. I dont
really know wether that is a bonobo bug, but since it throws all those
error messages it seems like it cannot get the german strings, right?

Thank you..

Subject: [Evolution] Pilot support?

(thanks again for Helix GNOME and Evolution. They're great! Especially the
Debian support.)

I just downloaded Peter's new Debian packages to my Debian box. Is the Palm
Pilot integration there enough yet for me to give it a whirl?

if so, could someone point me in the direction to get that going? I know how to
plug my cradle into the serial port but not sure what to do after that. :-)

fwiw, I currently use JPilot to sync my Pilot to my Red Hat box.

thanks in advance,
david

Looks like you haven't installed GConf, or, at the very least - it's not
being found when you configure/build

I confirmed that my IMAP software I'm using does indeed support the SEARCH
command so it must still must be evolution isn't compliant quite yet.

>From the main programmer of our email software:
"SEARCH command is the part of the IMAP standard. <Email software> supports it,

I switched over to POP and SEARCH works great.

#I did this to protect beta testers from accidently deleting their mail :-)

Can you unprotect us in 0.3?  Everyone knows to backup their email.  I just
created another IMAP account and copied my .mbox'es over to my new account to
test it out. So I'm prepared to crash and burn all email.

Refiling (with POP) doesn't immediately remove the message from the current
folder although I would envision it will in future versions I hope.

Under Local (POP3) why does it display Draft, Trash, Outbox, etc. they don't
exist or work?  Shouldn't it be able to create those on the fly?  Only by
creating new folder am I able to refile messages into those folders. Yep just
reread Dan Winship's message and he indicates they're still not quite there yet.

Virtual Folder Druid.  I thought this was working somewhat.I tried creating
From rule / added address someone@company.com but couldn't get it to show any
messages.  Does it only apply to new incoming messages perhaps?  I thought
vfolders are supposed to look in the INBOX (for now..other folders in the
future) and display only based on the rule criteria.

So I put edited the address from someone@company.com to "First Last"
<someone@company.com> and it bombed.  Isn't " " and < > a proper standard?

Subject: [Evolution] To-do list does not belong with the Calendar.

IMO.  I think evolution should take its To-do list code out of the
Calendar and add it as another 'module' (or whatever component, etc) to
the sidebar ('evolution shortcuts').

I believe this was just left over from the Gnome Calendar.  Since this
is in Evolution now it should just become a module on the sidebar :)

Yeah, I haven't coded SEARCH support for IMAP yet - as I first need a
daemon to test it with :-)

It's an optional command, as stated by the RFC (rfc2060)

Yeah, I probably will...I'm pretty confidant in the code anyways

You mean with mbox (when you use pop it downloads mail to mbox and that's
where searching/refiling are used) :-)
And you're right about it not removing the file from the original mbox,
because the way it works right now is to mark it as deleted (which doesn't
remove it from the mbox folder). I believe future versions will behave the
same, but if people don't like that idea I guess we could do it the other
way.

Probably because the "mbox" file doesn't exist in those folders, it'd
probably work if you went `touch ~/evolution/local/Draft/mbox`

Can you explain this a little clearer - I'm not sure what you mean

The evolution packages can be found on the second server listed in the
mirrors. I believe it's specially marked as the Evolution test server

I realized this a little bit before I received this email.  When I downloaded the sources, I put them in a directory called evolution.  So I figured maybe that was the problem.  After removing the directory, and restarting evolution, it worked great!!!  Thanks a lot!

No, Pilot integration is not working yet. Two people are currently

No, the To-do list is a nice thing to have together with the calendar,
mainly because you don't just want to have a list of things to do; you
also want to have dates to go with them. The DateBook+ for PalmOS does
display to-do lists together with the calendar view, and it's a very
cool feature that I use all the time.

Also, you can store your to-do information in the same iCalendar file
that the calendar is using.

Anyway, I think we are also going to have a separate to-do icon for the
to-do list in the shortcut bar.

If there is something else that's printing somewhere else that I don't

Subject: [Evolution] Problesm with threads

Hi,

I've just installed the latest rpms under my installation of Mandrake 7.0.
It all looks great but I'm experiencing problems with threading the
subjects. I'm getting mail from a copy of my internal UNIX mailbox so 
it's all pretty standard.

If I enable threading in the middle of an evolution session, then there
appears to be no reason for the grouping of messages (cirtainly not on
subjectx - re:subjectx). I've tried sorting the inbox on sender, subject
and date - in both accending and decending orders but it has no effect.

However, if I leave threading on, exit evolution and start it up again,
then the threading is all OK. That is until I resort on any of the above
or 'get mail' again. The the treading goes out of the window.

I may me slow and this may already be noted but just in case.......

Steve

Subject: [Evolution] Re: [Helix Beta] Evolution 0.2 RPMs

Hi:

Just a couple of quick questions for a potential tester:

1.	Will Evolution allow leaving mail on a pop server yet so that I can
test it
	without loosing messages?

2.	I currently use Balsa for email - is there any way to import my old
mail into
	Evolution for testing purposes?

Thanks in advance for your answer, and for all your efforts.

Regards,

I just downloaded the preview 2 of evolution and it looks pretty good, but when
I try and check my mail with it I get the following error:

This is a user account.  I also tried this using root and it worked fine.
Has anyone else had this problem?  How do you get it to work for a user account.

No, POP still deletes mail off the server... :-(

You should just be able to copy balsa mailboxes into evolution as they use
the same format

The reason this failed as a normal user is because it doesn't have the
required permissions to create a file in /var/spool/mail/

We are aware of this problem and we will probably need to write an external
movemail program that can be set setuid (you wouldn't want evolution to be
setuid ;-)

A temp fix is to give your user access to create files there, but for a
multiuser system I wouldn't suggest it

Hi Dan,

Trying again for the command line to load Evolution this time it did give
me a bit more of a message but normally it's just the "Could not activate
component OAFIID" message. Here's the one I got this time - hopefully
this'll help :-)

Thank-you very much!

We may have to take you up on that offer :-)
I'll talk to Dan and Nat and see how they'd like to do it (my guess is that
we'll probably end up using the freeware one)

Okay, well there are 2 places where this can happen in the vfolder config
tool - 1 is "select messages with these characteristics" and one is "don't
show me any with these characteristics" so perhaps you are setting them
both? I dunno.  Also, filtering/vfolders are still under development...

That should work, but it may not be as tight of a rule...

Subject: [Evolution] Comments on Calendar/Contacts

Hi there, 

Just curious if birthdays entered in to the Contacts will be inserted
into the Calendar. I was thinking either graying out the field (having
the current date in there can be confusing) and having a checkbox to
enable the field. If enabled then inserting into the calendar would be
great for reminders. Also, does it make sense to store a year for the
birthday? Most people don't know the year that someone is born and it
seems more intuitive to have a separate field for the year which can be
left blank than to leave a non-valid year in there.

On the Caldendar view I like that the current month is displayed clearly
for the first three views, but it takes a little hunting around ont he
month view to see it in the first day's box. I can guess you're probably
trying to keep the gray bar above the calendar clean, but it'd be nice
if the month view could display the month a little more clearly.

Thanks for all the great work!

Ok, I played with this a little bit more and realized that the current
implementation is probably the best because you can have parts of
multiple months displayed simultaneously. Please ignore ;0)

Subject: [Evolution] Multiple sources

 I can't seem to be able to specify multiple sources
via the druid. It keeps replacing old server with new.


 Same goes for addresses. 

 I tried adding them to the "source" line in config,
but it didn't work.

 Is there a way to do this by hand?

 Btw, I am using the rpms.

Subject: "Fix that From: tag"

Usually email clients only let you edit To, Cc, Bcc, and Subject.
But what if we could edit the Reply-To, right when your writing an email?
Of course the To tag would still be the same as your REAL email address but the
Reply-To would be an easier way of saying "you should take this up with so and
so at helixcode".

And as for the From-List tag, I've seen a thing similar in the mbox format for
a while now. And it would be nice if that showed up in your basic headings when
you simply view the message as normal. 

Does anyone like this idea?

Just an idea.

No thats bullshit, mail dir permissions of 1777 are perfectly safe
on multiuser systems.

But some systems are a bit anal about "security" and make it 
setgid mail, and some require setuid root permissions to set .locks.

Anyway, I said eons ago we should have an external movemail progra
but nobody listened.

Yes, but evolution matches against the email address part, after
its been decoded frorm the message.  The from thing should work,
but the druid's got issues so it might not even b e creating
the rule propely (its in the midst of a reqrite).

This is planned.  But there will also be a little task list next to
the day view in the calendar, just like it is right now.

We are going to have a more detailed view of the task list for the
full-blown shell component.  In addition, the little view next to the
calendar's day view will be enhanced to be prettier and more
functional.

Hey, this is a nice idea!  I just put in a bugzilla entry for it.  It

Subject: [Evolution] VFolder wishlist

I have been experimenting with evolution-mail's VFolders. I figured a
good test would be to see if it can emulate my netscape-mail folder
structure. My netscape mail folders are mostly of three types:

- messages from a particular mailing list
- discussions with particular people or groups of people
- emails related to ongoing projects (eg. work)

I was able to emulate the first nicely, the second sort of, and the
third not at all (my goal is to use VFolders, not actual folders).

The second could be achieved with a more powerful expression syntax (ie.
allowing "or" as well as "and", and allowing subexpressions), but a
shortcut option would be nice too (like the To-and-CC shortuct).

The third might be implemented by allowing users to assign arbitrary
attributes to emails (manual filing) and then filtering based on those
attributes. That might be tricky to implement but I think it would be
very useful.

While VFolders can't match my netscape mail folders exactly (unless you
can assign arbitrary attributes),  I understand there is a lot of
potential to provide features netscape can't provide (particularly,
overlapping views). In this area, I'd like to be able to filter based on
additional criteria:

- emails sent within a certain time period
- unread/new emails.
- unreplied emails.

In addition, for any VFolder I'd like to be able to easily switch to
showing only new (unread) messages for that VFolder, or alternately only
showing unreplied messages.

On the topic of unreplied messages, a custom email attribute might come
in useful here to be used instead of "replied". I would find it more
useful to record that an email has been "dealt with". For me, this means
either that I have replied to the email, or I have read it and decided
I'm not going to reply to it. Having this attribute means that I can
easily view all emails that I have not yet dealt with. I can imagine a
new column in the email list view with a toggle which I can click once
I've delt with a message. Replying to a message would automatically flag
the email as "dealt with".

There already is a GNU movemail program possibly it can be
used.  Netscape uses it.  I'm not sure about it's security but it should
be a good base to start from.

Subject: [Evolution] comments on todo list

Hi I've been playing with evolution, and noticed the following thing about
the todo list...

When I delete items, the item that becomes the current item appears to be
fairly random.  The behavior that I would prefer is that it went to either
the item directly above, or directly below, or chronologically above or
below..

In addition to deleting items, I would much prefer to complete the item
(which would be signified by say, a strike through of the item summary...)

It would also be nice to have the origination date and due date listed with
the summary (as well as a followup date, if it is added...)

A couple of nice features that I've found in other ToDo managers are the
following...

Have the Todo associated with a contact, company, and/or project.
Have it associatable with multiple companies/contacts/projects -
For instance, in the construction industry, projects are coordinated among
10s - 100s of sub contractors, contractors, architects, and engineers.  Thus
a piece of information often has to be tracked with many individuals and
companies.  Also, because many of the same companies and people are working
on many different projects, it is also valuable to track the project that
the task is associated with.

The way "Commence 2000" (a contact manager specifically targeted at the
construction industry) does this is by having three additional fields

To do for companies, projects, contacts

each of which has a widget that creates 'one to many' relationships

There are also four other fields that are somewhat useful

Todo for appointment
Related to task
To do Journal
Originated by

I think the 'to do journal' is somewhat redundant, since other views should
provide essentially the same information.

Other useful fields are the "Follow Up date", "Recurring", "Share", "Type",
"Duration", "Start date" and "date completed".

I'll try and find some time to do an interface mock up, to give you a better
idea of what they use for a layout..

PS - thanks for all of the excellent work that has gone into Evolution (and
the gnome libraries, and all of the other great GNU contributions)

will evolution be upgraded via the helix-updater?  i just installed the .2
version and am hoping that my weekly check with the updater will aid the
upgrading of evolution.

Yes, as new releases of evolution are made, they will be made
available as updates.

btw, there is a reason why evolution doesn't use "." (~/.evolution)
like others apps ?

How will the way Evolution handles scripts/html/executables
be different than that of Outlook/Outlook Express?  Or will
Evolution users be just as exposed to the ravages of user
hostile mail as Windows users?

I'd say one of the best lines of defense that we have is that Evolution will
not be integrated into your system like Outlook/Express are in Windows.
This means that a hostile email can't corrupt stuff on your system, it
might crash Evolution but that'd be the worst it could do.

You *will* still have to be careful about running shell scripts/executables
that come as attachments though, however we will probably have Evolution
save them to disk with your default file permissions (which for the average
user is 644 - meaning the average user will NOT be able to just run these
programs; they'll have to chmod them first).

Obviously there will still be dangers. Even using a mailer like pine or elm
you have to be careful about running attachments.

Hopefully Miguel or someone will answer your question with a little more
detail than I have, but I hope my answer has answered at least most of your
questions.

If you mean Bonobo 0.15, gtkhtml 0.5, gnome-vfs 0.2, libunicode 0.4, OAF
0.4.  I installed these files.  My guess was that the OAF 0.4 has smething
to do with the error.  I am not sure what I did or didn't do that was wrong.

Did you download the supplemental files also? I had a problem similar

Evolution will be using iCalendar shortly (we use the older vCalendar
now), and it does support defining a hierarchy of related to-do
items.  This will be supported.

Thanks for your suggestions,

Do you plan to add category-support to the todo-list? I once hacked
this is gnomecal, and talked about it shortly during guadec (yes, this
is the category-dialog in gnomecal that still offers 'guadec' as a
todo-category ;-). I must admit you're Outlook-inspired dialog is much
nicer, though icons would be nice... However, would you be interested
to use this same dialog in the todo list? Or if someone sent you a patch?

(Some people say you have too much to if you need to add categories to
your todo-list, while others say you have too little to do if you have
the time to add categories.... however, i find them quite useful...)

There is no document outlining what the final version of Evolution will look
like

Evolution *will* handle news, a lot of the code is already in CVS

The same reason pine uses 'mail', and elm uses 'Mail', no doubt.

Its not just for configuration data, but for user data like
mailbox files.

Subject: [Evolution] evolution install problem

Hey,
  In my helix-update list of mirrors I see one titled Evolution
Preview, located in Boston, type HTTP.  However, when I attempt
to connect to this mirror, I get an error stating that helix-update
was unable to download a list of updates.  I'm able to use the
other mirrors just fine.
  Because of this problem I decided to download the new evolution
snapshot by hand (and all the other packages necessary to install
it).  It all appears to work just fine -- I just felt someone
should know about this problem.

Regards,
  cyberclay

I'm glad it handles news. I was worried about that. Pan is too slow and doesn't
look right for me. Hope to see some interface for evolutions news soon. =)

I have a question...
Will you be able to use Evolution without the shell.
For example just open evolution-mail, evolution-calender or evolution-news with
it's own _seperate_ interface, or will we have to use the shell?

Tony

You'll have to run the shell. evolution-mail, evolution-calendar and
evolution-addressbook are bonobo components, they can't do much without
being embedded in something.

Subject: [Evolution] a few quick Qs

Four quick questions from an interested user:

1) will it be possible to have the threaded view non-expanded by
default.
(or have an option to make it non-expanded by default, if that makes
sense :-)

2) will evolution notice if mail is added to the mbox (eg. by procmail)
behind its back?
(atm, you have to restart evolution first)

3) will evolution be able to understand the 'Status: RO' lines in mbox
files (for imports, etc.)

and just to finish it off:
4) will the task list in the calendar have 'checkboxes' for when
something is done (but you don't want to delete it)?

thanks;

As usual, this being a 1.3.x release, I haven't even compiled this
kernel yet. So if it works, you should be doubly impressed.

Subject: [Evolution] Beginning work on evolution

Yay!!!! With the new release of evolution-0.2 I can finally compile and
run evolution! Thank you guys so much for your hard work. This project
is so exciting! 

Now that I have it compiled and running, I'd like to try to add a few
options I find convenient/important in other mail programs. I'd like to
try to work on the IMAP support. 

- There doesn't yet seem to be an option for "leave mail on server".
Hopefully this is the default, but I imaging there should be an option
in the mail config. 

- Also, mail within subfolders isn't being picked up. 

What about multiple mail servers? Is there someone working on this? I
dont know of another mail program that does this well, but I'd really
like to have one. 

So, where anyone have any pointers as to where I can learn about IMAP? I
have  experience programming c++ for linux/mac/win at deneba software (
http://www.deneba.com/linux ), but not specifically with mail programs.
I was the lead of the project to port Canvas7 to linux. But
unfortunately, they used wine, so I did not get to do a lot of great
gnome hacking like I want to. Canvas7 is a corel draw like mixture of
gimp and dia, or photoshop and illustrator, in case you've never heard
of it.

Anyway, I'm really hoping to help with this project. I've wanted to get
into some open source projects for a long time, but this one is
particularly exciting. The office I work in is married to outlook, and
its frequently a thing people tell me they can't live without and
therefore could never switch to linux. So I'd love to see a outlook
compatible program with all or more of the features it has! Since its so
hard to get people to transition from their software, outlook
compatibility is important. 

If anyone has any pointers for me, I would greatly appreciate them. I'm
gonna go start looking at the source and looking for imap info now...

Thanks again!
 michael

Hrmmfrmmhmmfrrmmhmmhmmfruuummm...

Oh, excuse me, I had my foot in my mouth. 
Now that I've read a little of the imap documentation, I see there isn't
much need for a "delete from server" option for imap. That must be a pop
option. And looking at the evolution-0.2 announcement on the mailing
list, I see that we only recently got basic imap support thanks to jeff.

I found some imap docs at, who would've guessed? http://www.imap.org

So, I'll continue to read them and try to look at the source. Does
anyone have anything specific in mind for imap? Is there a spec of
desired stuff? 

thanks for the patience,
michael

Some users would like to actually have a 'download from server' option -
in effect using imap merely as a receiving spool the same way POP
is generally used.

> I found some imap docs at, who would've guessed? http://www.imap.org

rfc 2060 and related rfc's are good references (no doubt linked
from there).;

Well I think we want it to support everything  in camel, and
support it well :)  Jeff is doing
most of the work right now, eh shoudk now the state, and him, Dan, 
and Ettore shoukd now where its headed.

I know one feature which is missing completely is supporting the
search interface (assuming i just haven't missed it anyway)- Jeff doens't
have an imap server that supports it to test with.  It would
be nice also for it to support a subset of search operations
(those that can be determined from the summary only)
as well, since many imap servers dont support searching.
Not sure if anyones working on it yet, but it shouldn't be
too hard a thing to do (few days work maybe).

 Michael

Subject: [Evolution] imap subfolders

Looking at camel-imap-folder.c, I see that you always check that the
folder name is "INBOX". I'm guessing here that this is why none of the
messages in other folders are being seen. You do this in init,
get_message_count, and some other places. Are you sure that the folder
name handling is correct for the else cases there?

Also, I was trying to find the code for the "get mail" button so I could
track down why we're not getting imap mail. Can anyone point me in the
right direction? I was looking in e-shell-view.c and it looks like it's
the application bar? It that right? And there's a proc somewhere for
it(?)...

thanks

Disconnected IMAP is the most wanted on my list.  This is alot better than 
connected and offline.

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution + HTML

Hi,

I've noticed that evolution was handling html attachment with ease, the
rendering is very nice and efficient. I've made some test with yahoo, altavista etc...
it works great !

I wonder if this html engine can be called anywhere in the gnome environment
using the bonobo component (like explorer in windows) and if there is any plan to
make a gnome html browser available with the evolution html engine ?

Thanks

Eric

I agree. Also, removing the grey lines between each message might make
the shape of the thread clearer (like in Netscape Mail).

On threads, I noticed a couple of minor bugs. Sometimes the messages in
a thread are shown out of order. For example, the reply might come
first, and the original message second. Other times, it shows messages
in the same thread when they should be in different threads. Maybe the
first problem is happening because the code assumes that the mbox is
already sorted by date, or that a reply always has a later date than the
email it is replying to. But that's just a guess.

You shoud rely on draft-crispin-imapv rather than rfc2060, as it specifies
what to do with no us-ascii foldernames, and that sort of thing. You can find
it at: http://www.imc.org/draft-crispin-imapv

Yep, thats the way to do it right now.

It seems 'intuitive'?  Conceptually thats what you're 
doing anyway.  Anyone think of a better way to do the
gui for
this?

Well bascally, 'get mail' is only for pop/local mbox email.
imap merely queries the server for emssages.  get mail is used to
download messages into the local store ...

No, no sorting is expected freom the contents of th emailboxl.

The main criterea used for threading is the messages 'in-rely-to' and
'referendes' headers.  After thats all done, the sorting is based on the 
sent-date.  So yesl, this could be a bit out, since the sent date
depends on the sender having the correct offset from gmt int he
email.

The last criteria used is the subject.  So i find it very unliklely
that you are getting genuinly wrong threaded messages (its using the
same algorithm as used in netscape 3).

Perhaps a reset button next to the search box? I am forced to use M$ outlook
at work, and this was one of the little non-intuitive quirks I had to figure
out, to unfilter your message you have to search for " " ;-)

	I must add that i've observed this behaviour also. I was trying to
reproduce it but evolutions didn't cooperate.

 One thing that i noticed was the following. I am using imap to read the same
folders that balsa does, where procmail delivers the mais. In some folders
there were messages wich were marked as new but i couldn't read it. It looked
like they had been deleted but there was still a record of their presence.
Folders with this problem also showed the above behavior.

	I'll try to get a screenshot and then i'll post an url to it.

	See y'a

Subject: [Evolution] Pb with bonobo

Hi,

I have compiled without problems all sources, but
evolution don't work. 
I received this message on my console:
Bonobo-WARNING **: Can not resolve initial reference to RootPOA
and a window with this message :  Cannot initialize bonobo system 

Did you have any idea? I could try to debug, but i don't find the option
in the configure to add the option -g in the compilation of source.

Thanks for your help

I'm checking to see if the mailbox name is "INBOX", yes. This is because
that is the ONLY folder that doesn't ever have a namespace. The rest of
the folders I need to prepend the namespace to before selecting it. And
I have no idea what you're talking about when you say "I'm guessing here
that this is why none of the messages in other folders are being seen."
If it's not working for you then please send me debug output? This works
for me and everyone else who's tried IMAP in Evolution recently.

Get Mail has nothing to do with IMAP currently, we may at some point
make it so that clicking on Get Mail will reload the IMAP folder
summary, but it would be better if I could get this working
automatically when we get new mail on the server. This is one of the few
parts of IMAP that needs to be coded (other than disconnected IMAP).

 It's actually working so well, I have to wait forever
for it to scan my 150Mb home directory  and all gmc

I don't appreciate the sarcasm especially since this is not the fault of
my imap code, and you can easily fix this by hand editing the
~/evolution/config file and appending the correct namespace to the
"source=" line

eg, mine looks like: source=imap://fejj@trna.helixcode.com/mail

We may even have this working in the mail-config code by now, it seems
as 
though it was working last night but I have yet to actually test it
myself.

Hopefully that helps

This usually means you compiled some parts against oaf and some
against goad. You will need to rebuild the parts you built against
goad.

If you re-sort the message list (by clicking on one of the headings),
then threading will break (in 0.2). Unsorting it (by right-clicking
the heading and choosing "Unsort") will fix it.

DO NOT do that! Evolution does not do any locking of its own files,
and if you change them while it is running, it may later overwrite
parts of them with "wrong" data.

What you want to do is to use procmail to filter mail into one mbox,
and then tell Evolution to fetch mail from that mbox into its own.

What does "Status: RO" mean? (That's not part of any standard AFAIK.)

> How will the way Evolution handles scripts/html/executables
> be different than that of Outlook/Outlook Express?

HTML: GtkHTML does not currently support javascript. If it does in the
future, Evolution will disable that. Evolution does not currently
fetch remote images in HTML message bodies, because that can be used
by spammers to verify that you've received the message. (At some
point, it will be possible to tell Evolution "ok, load the images",
but currently there's no way to do it.)

Scripts/executables: Evolution does not and will not have the ability
to run scripts/executables attached to messages. There is the problem
of, eg, an Excel document with a malicious VB script in it. This needs
to be dealt with by the app being used to display the attachment. (In
this case, Gnumeric, which will use GNOME BASIC to safely run the VB
script without damage to your environment.) But this means that any
program used to display an attachment needs to be audited to make sure
it's safe against malicious data.

 Actually I was kidding you, but technically it was
sarcasm. Yep it isn't your code, and I fixed it by
going the full path thinggy a couple of days ago.

 But this led me to: why the heck doesn't starmail of
the very bloated StarOffice spend so much time on my
imap even though I didn't give it any namespace? 

 The answer is because it defaults to:

 INBOX, Trash

 and that's it. Now It shows me a list in an option
window so that I could "subscribe" to folders. Exactly
like Netscape news thing. But it somehow is faster
since it doesn't try to download all the folders at
once (like netscape and evolution do) but each when
needed (when a dir is expanded in other words it will
fetch it one level down and stop). I think in the end
this approach is faster. 


 Peace

Subject: [Evolution] Default VFolders

 This might have been discussed to death. But in case
it wasn't I think the following would be nice for the
vfolder trick to be cool.

 Highlight the from address in each message and give
it a callback so that by left-clicking I'd jump into a
temporary vfolder containing all this person's mail.
By right-clicking I'd be able to create a permanent
vfolder for this person or add this person to my
address book.

 Have default unread vfolder.

 Same of course goes for sent messages. Say I want to
look for messages I sent to foo.....

We'll have categories for calendar events & todo items.
Chris Lahey has written a nice category editor for the address book, which
we'll probably pinch (is that what you were referring to?).
We just need to change the default list of categories for this.

I'm creating a new dialog to edit tasks now, so I'll probably add it.

I have a bunch of folders on my company's outlook server. They show up 
in the folder bar as being at the same level as the inbox but they're 
empty. Should I look into this or is there something else thats more 
pressing? What parts are you working on, I don't want to dupilcate any 
effort.

Yeah, that method may be faster and we may want to do that eventually.
Currently, though, the front-end is not very imap loving :-)
We'll be fixing this as we go... Hopefully by M3 IMAP will be integrated
more smoothly.

It's known that Evolution has issues with Exchange servers, if you
happen to figure out the problem great, if not we'll be installing an
Exchange server locally here that I can use to help debug.

Yes. I thought Federico wrote it. Chris did a very nice job!

Very nice. Good luck.

Subject: [Evolution] calendar appointments with attached notes

Hello.

I've been trying Evolution (the 0.2 RPMS) and so far I like it.

The calendar program on my Palm Pilot allows notes of an arbitrary
length to be attached
to an appointment. Is there any way to do that in the Evolution
calendar, or is this feature
planned for the future?

By the way, the thing that excites me the most about Evolution is the
prospect of
being able to use a M$ Exchange server's calendar, address book, and
e-mail
services from a Linux workstation. If that pans out, my wife won't have
any excuses
left for continuing to use Windows!

Thanks.

--Tony

This is planned, and will be in place with the new iCalendar support.
Basically you just stick your text in the DESCRIPTION field of an
iCalendar component.

Nothing in this example, of course - but then, that was sent using mutt.
The message I sent before that was sent with evolution, and had a From
line of

From: <>

(which is why it was filled in to "evolution-admin" by the mailing list
software) even though I had correctly set my identity.

First of all, well done to evolution developers. It is looking good.

Now to my question. I used evolution to read mail from my local inbox in
/var/spool/mail

It has taken all the mail and converted it to a different format. Is the
new format some standard format, and is there a utility to convert it back
so that I can use pine to access those messages which were still in my
inbox?

Guy.

It hasn't really changed the format.  pine is just more particular
ab out what it epects as a From line.  Look back in the message
archives, someone had something for this.

What if you only took away the lines from within a thread but there would still
be lines between messages which arent in the thread? Is that what you meant?

the solution i came up with was this:

create a user 'bob' in my normal user's group, w/ just pop access.
make /var/spool/mail/bob group-writeable

put this at the top of my ~/.procmailrc:

:0 Dc:
/var/spool/mail/bob

set evolution to pull mail from 'bob's pop account.

and that works.

Subject: [Evolution] Thoughts on Preview 0.2

Hello,

I've been using Evolution Preview 0.2 for the last few days and would
like to offer some feedback mostly on UI issues. I'm sure that a
number of these issues are already planned to be addressed in future
releases, but I thought I'd bring them up before it's too late, so to
speak.

  My primary machine is a thinkpad 240 which has a rather tiny screen
  measuring in at 800x600. Evolution uses a lot of extraneous screen
  space which makes reading mail less efficient. These suggestions
  might help tighten up the use of space.

    * The button bar beneath the menu. I hope that it will be possible
      to a) hide the text, b) hide the icons, c) hide the whole
      bar. These button's actions would be soon replaced by
      function-key combinations for many people.

    * The shortcut bar. This uses up an incredible amount of screen
      space for limited functionality. Again, here it'd be nice to be
      able to hide the icons, text or both. A horizontal orientation,
      maybe at the bottom of the window I think would work better. The
      icons could highlight depending on which component you're using
      at the moment. (small icons)

    * It would be nice to be able to change the list and message
      default font sizes.

    * The various druids pop up many many many dialog boxes. I think
      many of these could be better integrated as fields rather than
      independent dialogs. Tabbed dialog boxes would also help reduce
      clutter.

 Other UI ideas:

    * along the grey bar where it says "inbox": What if the "inbox"
      was really a pop-up menu which let you choose between your
      folders? This would save me lots of space.

    * once a search is completed successfully, a
      button/key-combo/menu-item to turn that search into a virtual
      folder.

    * Can I Vfolders encompass everything. I.E. Everything (contacts,
      emails, chats, appointments) with Big Boss?

    * I'd like to be able to drag and drop emails into folders.

 Minor issues:

    * When I select Tools->Filter Druid... (or VFolder Druid), the
      dialog box which appears has a misleading descriptor. Shouldn't
      it be "Select rule" rather than Select rule type"? Isn't it
      displaying the rules which are already set up for filtering
      rather then categories for rules? or am I missing something.
      Also, in this dialog box, it would default to a quick glance
      what my filter are, so rather than listing them by type, it'd be
      nice to see their descriptions filled in. I.e. If I have a
      filter "Copy incoming messages from a certain address to
      specific folder" can it default to the supplied values: "Copy
      incoming messages from 'Anne Hunter' to 'trash'"

    * When selecting multiple messages, it would be nice if the read
      status would not be changed. When I select a bunch of mails,
      it's usually to refile them, and I don't want their "read"
      status changed.

    * When refiling, only the folders of the correct type should show
      up. If I can't move my email to my contacts, why am I even given
      the choice?

I am terrificly impressed with the work the Evolution team has
done. My commendations on your progress. I hope these suggestions are
useful.

       Rony

This seems to work:

sed -e 's/^From - $/From foo@bar  Wed Jul 19 08:52:14 2000/' \
~/evolution/local/Inbox/mbox | formail -I 'From ' -s formail \
>newmbox

Or if you don't mind all the "From " lines containing junk, just
do the sed part :)

By the way, would it be possible for Evolution to generate
"^From " lines of the form "From user@host  `date`"?  Even if
"From - " is valid, pine, elm, mutt, formail etc. don't think
it is.  It would be nice to interoperate better with other
MUA's.

Well, a workaround for this is to drag the toolbar out of the
window.  (Drag the vertical bar on the left of the toolbar.)
Then just bring the window to the front again.  :)

Well, you can hide the whole thing by clicking on
View|Show shortcut bar.

Outlook can be made to do this.  I think it would be useful.

My 2 cents.  I use Outlook at work and Netscape 4.7 at home.  Both will
show me (at times) the reply before the original, so I am guessing it's
the user having the wrong time for thier client (as was mentioned
before)...

I assume it's so that you don't have your POP/IMAP passwds
hanging around in memory and also so that if you leave your desk
for a bit, but don't log out/lock your display, nobody else can
download your mail and read it while you're gone :)

Then again, if you're going to go to the trouble of "forgetting"
your passwords before you leave, you may just as well lock your
desktop...

Please someone correct me if I'm wrong.

 Why movemail?

 Why the heck can't email apps read the sys mail in
/var/whatever/mail instead of moving it to their
folder?

 Netscape does this, evolution does this, others need
imap access to localhost for God's sake!

 This is ugly. If I am away, can't connect via X to my
machine or for any other reason, then I can't use
pine, elm or any other email tool to read system mail,
no instead I need to change folders and such to get to
that mail.

 Why? Why? Why?

Seems like an interface issue. How about a feature that says "On startup,
go to this folder". Solves the problem isn't it since your concern seems
to be having to change folders.

Yeah!  You should just do what Netscape does!

Oh wait.

Netscape supports an external movemail.

You can do this by putting the appropriate categories in your
contacts.  I have my own "groupies" category, but alas, Evolution
keeps displaying an empty set for it.

If we eventually use a GtkHTML component to edit the long description,
how is this going to work with the Palms? They can only handle plain
text, right?

I suppose we can convert to plain text to send to the Palm, but if
the description is edited on the Palm any formatting may be lost.
Just warn the user?

Subject: [Evolution] New user setup and existing vCards

I just downloaded and installed Evolution 0.2.  The new user setup 
script worked well, and things seem to be running smoothly.  I 
copied my existing gnomecal vCal file over "~/evolution/local/Calenda
r/calendar.vcf"; however, the addressbook seems to be in database 
format.  How do I incorporate my existing vCards into Evolution 
without reentering the data (or some other piece-meal method)?  Is 
there a script out there to insert the vCards in my GnomeCard file 
into the database?

I know Evolution is far from production-ready, but I would like have 
a bunch of data around to test Evolution in a more realistic manner.

Regards,

 That might solve problem for some, but I really see

Erm. I didn't say it was impossible. I said it was "hard to do". Which
file locking mechanism do you suggest we use for mail? I'm largely
unfamiliar with Python so I have no idea how they do it in a portable
fashion.

I guess if the user tries to sync back an object from the Pilot that
already exists in Evolution, and if the Evolution object has HTML data
in it, we can put up a warning to tell the user that the new
description will lose all HTML information.

Most of the time this should not be a problem; only people with too
much time in their hands (i.e. those who do not need a calendar) spend
the time to put bold and italic and fonts in their appointment
descriptions :-)

I meant to have a flat background with no lines anywhere. This is how
netscape mail does it, and I find it easier to read. Maybe it is also
because I prefer the font netscape uses (can we configure this in
evolution too?)

X-Mailer: Balsa 0.9.0

I think on of my main attractions to Evolution, concerning the GUI, was that it
had lines like Outlook Express 5 for MacOS. Which for me is easier to read
because it just looks nicer, in my opinion. But, I am using Balsa which doesn't have
lines and it works just fine for basic mailing needs. It's just so confusing to
have it all packed into one field and not seperated. But I think that because of
the way widgets are set up we would either have to add a lot more code for
options or just leave it the way it is right now.

Does Outlook Express have a threaded view? If so, how does it display

 I am not an expert at this. The only I worried about
file locking, I discovered under python that there was
a posix way of doing this. Now all unix's and even
windows nt are posix compliant.

 Python always provide a layer to make things
portable. Anyway, as far as I know the module is
called fcntl and is an interface to UNIX fcntl and
ioctl routines.
 The locking is done via FCNTL.F_SETLK/FCNTL.F_SETLKW.

 That is the most I could get. You'd have to look at
code to see how they make this portable.

Thought so. Take a peek at the URL Jamie posted that dealt with how
Netscape dealt with movemail. Note the comments about fcntl locking and
what happens when you apply it to NFS. This is part of what I was talking
about when I said it's hard to do.

X-Mailer: Balsa 0.9.0

For MacOS in version 5.0 it does. Basically it is like Netscape Communicator,
but it is much more fluent and has lines between each message. It shows them by
date, which can be out of order because of timezones, lag and wrong-set clocks. It
is the exact same way in the OE5 newsreader. The other feature I love about
OE's list display is that you can choose which headers you want to show up. I
should mention that the OE5 display widget is based on MacOS's Finder "Sort/List
View" widget which is much nicer than the actual OE5 thing. 

I really don't think that this is any big deal, it's just a widget and will
probably be changed as Gtk+ progresses and new themes are invented. And it might
just be a lot better for everyone if all of the widgets in Evolution had
_options_. Personally I think every single widget in Gtk+ and all related programs should
have more options! Do any of you remember KDE 1.1.2, the way you could tweak
the widgets? They messed that up in 2.0 but Gtk+ is very flexible and could use
more options. Just add more technical stuff to the "Applications" panel in
"Control Center" <gnomecc> and rename it Widgets.  

I was just wondering, will all the widgets that are in Evolution be availible
through Gtk+ in the future? I really like that Shortcuts bar and would like to
use it in other programs without copying the code. It would be nice to see some of
that as plain old Gtk+ widgets.

I remeber reading about posix compliant and what that means once.  You
wont like the answer but it means next to nothing.

To be posix compliant all the functions must exist, but do not actually
have to function.  So a posix OS might include posix function
wipe_my_drive() that simply returns a fail, and does not even try to
wipe the drive.  

By having the function return a fail code apps that call it wont just
fall over, and thats basicaly what posix is about. 

Corect me if I am way off here, but that my understanding from a single
article.

Yes but locking isn't the only prob lem, with some systems you
need to do the locking as root, or setuid a particular user.
Mail systems generally use .locks anyway.  Its the setuid/setgid
locking/maildrop access that is the bigger problem, but still,
its not that  big if you just move your mail to another database ...

Well the table 'widget' in evolution is 'not just a widget' really, its
a rather specifically written and complex wiget called e-table.

It probably wont be part of gtk, because etable is canvas based, and also GPL
(not lgpl as required for gtk+).  It does everything itslef, including
having pluggable renderers for each part, so it needs stylising differntly.

Why is this? One of the things I like about gtk/gnome is its pervasise
style/behaviour changability. I don't want to have to go about
configuring every little detail just so that it behaves the same.

Ok, I understand there might be many problems.

Now evolution, netscape mail, and others use some
movemail to be able to avoid locking, setuid, setgid
... Great!

Then please move it back once done with it. In other
words fake imap even on systems without imap! This
shouldn't be a problem since those files are local
even though they might be coming from nfs.

Would that be too much work?

Because no other widget would do the job.  Its really as simple as that.

I dont know the plans in that area, but i presume they will become
more customisable, to match the rest of gtk.

Depending on your system you probably only have to change your
maildrop directory to mode 1777.  e.g. if it is currently

drwxrwxr-x    root    mail

Then you change it to 

drwxrwxrwt    root    mail

Dont use mode 777 as it is a security problem.

This will hopefully be addressed at some point (by 1.0?).

I don't have any clue what you mean by "fake imap".  As for moving it back, 
guess what... you get all the same problems back again. You have to deal with
locking the spool, because while you "moved" the file off into mailreader 
land new mail can have arrived. So now at somepoint to move it back you have 
to: (a) lock the spool. (b) incorperate the spool into your copy of the 
spool in some sesiable way. (c) put your "newer new spool" in place. (d) 
unlock the file so that the MTA can then add any mail that has arrived while
you were incorperating the "new to you, but old to the mta mail". 

By "fake imap" did you mean "create the illusion of folders within a single
file?  Yes that could be done, but it seems like an excessivly bad idea(tm). 

> Would that be too much work? 

Given that it makes the problem harder, I would imagin so..

hi

i have been using evolution it's quite good but also
quite big for machines without a lot of ram, it would
be good if the components (mail, contacts and
calendar) would be launched just when you press the
button to switch to them, not upon startup, that would
reduce memory consumpsion for those of us that just
need to read the email.

i would also be good if it would show a progress bar
when getting the email form the server...

thanks a lot for such a program and keep up the good
work!

Diego

Hi all,

I had a lookup at the latest (packaged) Evolution release yesterday and
I love it :)

I would like to see the IMAP support *greatly* improved though, it
currently does not work for me with Cyrus IMAPd server (it appears to be
using '/' as a path deliminator rather than a '.' which Cyrus uses), it
also seems very inefficient in it's commands, it issues around 4 FETCH's
per message, and even downloads the entire message body .. all the
fetch's could probably be combined by asking for all the info in one
command, and grabbing all the headers before body's.

I really think what the developers are doing with this is great, even
though it's immature I feel it will definitely blow all other graphical
mail clients away in the future :)

Yeah just hold your horses.  We thought it was more importatn
to have an imap that worked at all, rather than worked ideally.
So expect it to improve quite a bit with each next release.

So, I'm trying to debug the imap problems with exchange servers, but I
can't set a breakpoint in libcamel.
I type 

info shar

and I get a list of a lot of libraries, but no libcamel

so I try shar camel  and shar libcamel  and shar camel.so.0 and many
others... but none work. 

Any ideas how I can debug this lib? Why isn't it loaded, but I'm getting
imap mail?

You are debugging the evolution-=mail program, and not
just 'evolution' i presume?  (since its a non-linked component).

I also usually find i have to break on main beforfe
i can break on shared library symbols, and of course the
dynamically loaded stuff (libcamelimap for example)
you have to wait until its loaded by the application.
gdb goes spastic with the breakpoints if you then run again,
but its doable, if painful.

Indeed, BUT, you have to (or "movemail" has to) lock the mail
spool when you move it out in the first place, so if you can do
it once, why not twice?  I'm not saying it should be done, but
your argument that you can't lock it the second time doesn't
make much sense to me.

Subject: [Evolution] Fix for outlook folders at root level

Ok, I haven't been able to confirm my fix because it semes like none of
the changes I make are making any difference in the output of the
program. Maybe the library is loaded outside of evolution and I need to
force it to unload somehow, but whatever. 

From looking at the debug output, I can se the problem. 

When selecting a folder, which I assume goes to the function
imap_get_summary:
-first you select the folder with the name alone:
ie. for a folder named Storage...

sending: A00079 SELECT Storage

-this succeeds and you examine Storage
-then you status Storage to get the number of mesages. this succeeds
also.
-then, strangely, you select /Storage

sending: A00082 SELECT /Storage

which fails with

recieved: A00082 NO Mailbox name is invalid.

at which point you bail out. All of this takes place in
imap_get_summary, but my changes are apparently not doing anything, and
I can't break into the library yet. I'll keep trying to get it to
compile, I think you just have to change imap_command_extended, which
tries to select the folder first, and is apparently doing it wrong.
Maybe this is just for exchange folders, or maybe its just for folders
at the root level. Not sure yet. 

I'm really enjoying using evolution though. The tree view for replies to
messages is very cool.

Um, I'm not claiming that having to lock the file twice matters.  The 
issue I see is in rebuilding the spool in a way that is sensiable.  I don't
think for example putting the X-MUA-Magic-thingy most clients use to store
metadata belongs back in the spool.  With that said, the move-back would 
have to trim off all of the metadata; which would remove any chance of 
getting virtual-imap.  I assume by virtual-imap you are meaning the ability
to have folders without having folders. 

Maybe If i understood why you want this it would make sense to me; but 
basically I just can't see how it would be useful.

Well, I don't know what is meant by "virtual imap" either.  I'm
not the one who asked the question in the first place.  I was
just questioning what you said about not copying the stuff back
:)

The person who asked initially seemed just to want to be able to
read his mail with something like elm/mutt/pine when he only had
access to the machine via telnet.  As far as I can tell,
"mutt -f ~/evolution/local/Inbox/mbox" should do it as long as
you have everything in the Inbox and use VFolders instead of
"real" folders.  The only thing stopping this is the "From - "
lines that mutt/pine/elm don't like.

I have many more that follows.
It doesn"t crash evolution, i can use it (for a short time, it crashes
quite quickly after some pop retrievals)

Another point, when I create a Mail Folder it doesn't appears ..

Ok dude, I may have a useful suggestion ...

You have to make sure you 'make install' when you change the
codce -= otherwise i think you'll find its running th eold
versionl.  Oh, and you will probably also want to rtun 'killev' - 
otherwise the old components will still be running. (unless they've
crashed).

Give that a go, that will probably helkp your debugging efforts!

I did a make and make install every time I made a change and it didn't show.

How can you print from libraries? I tried

fprintf(stderr, "message");
but I would never see it. Does that just mean I wasn't running my code?

whats killev? there's no man page for it...

Yep, you're right - I was mostly just playing around to get the right info -
the latest code in CVS is a lot more efficient. It will still fetch the
entire message when the user requests it, but in the future it will only
grab the message 'part' that the user requests and cache them for any
future requests.

Are you running the latest CVS? I believe I fixed that problem (I could be
wrong though). I don't believe the problem was in get_summary, it was in
camel_imap_command_extended I believe (and a number of other places
actually).

let me see if I can reconstruct the problem...

problem code:
		if (url && url->path && strcmp (folder->full_name, "INBOX"))
			folder_path = g_strdup_printf ("%s%s%s", url->path + 1, dir_sep,
folder->full_name);
		else
			folder_path = g_strdup (folder->full_name);

fixed code:
		if (url && url->path && *(url->path + 1) && strcmp (folder->full_name,
"INBOX"))
			folder_path = g_strdup_printf ("%s%s%s", url->path + 1, dir_sep,
folder->full_name);
		else
			folder_path = g_strdup (folder->full_name);

let me explain: we need to check that the url path isn't just "/" because
the '/' is really just separates the host from the namespace, take the
following url for example:

imap://fejj@helixcode.com/mail

In this example, "/mail" is the url->path, but we've got to strip the
leading '/' off because that's not really part of the namespace. Now that
you've seen an example of a url with a namespace, lets look at one that
does not contain a namespace:

imap://guest@tazmanian-devil.helixcode.com/

In this example, the imap daemon does not use a namespace but notice that
url->path == "/", now - applying the original code and selecting a folder
called Storage, we get "/Storage"

tada ;-)

Sorry I missed you on IRC this morning

 Indeed, that's all I want. Be able to read my mail
with something else. It sometimes happens. 

 So, lock it or don't lock it or whatever, as long as
I can read my mail with pine, elm.... it's ok. That's
what pisses me for instance about StarOffice mail, it
uses a weird format to store messages.

 I don't know, maybe I am overdoing this, but that'd
be cool.

Subject: [Evolution] Deleteing Messages

HI All

How do I delete messages?  
I have gone and higlighted the message.  
I have clicked delete. 

I still have the messages....  So I click the actions-expunge menu...
I still have the messages.  Any day now I am going to be unable to find
my mail between the old junk.

Also, on a releated note, I like to read a folder, then select the last
message, select the first message and then press delete, but I had to
shift select every single message.  Will this be changed sometime?

And, releated to that, could the helix guys put up a web page of planned
features so that plain old wingeing users like my self can stop
requesting planed features :o)



Lets see, what else can I ask for today....  How about a solid gold
Monkey for all who purchase the CD?

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution through Helix Update

Greetings,

	I saw a message here a few days ago relating to this, but can't
find it now(it's been one of those weeks). 

	Anyway, the point of this message is that I also am unable to
download from the Evolution option under Helix Update. I am running a
pretty much stock (other than helix gnome) Mandrake 7.0 system. I was able
to download Evolution and install it from one of my work machines running
RedHat 6.2. Could it be a problem relating to the distro that a person is
running?

expunge is probably failing.  there's probably a tonne of debug output

Netscape Messenger (win version) shows threads as such I believe with lines drawn like in Evolution
...[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
.........[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
............[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
...............[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
...[HelixCode stuff]
...[golden monkey]

How about just having
...[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
......[Evolution 0.2 Preview]
...[HelixCode stuff]
...[golden monkey]
...[HelixCode stuff]

If this comes out unformatted then basically instead of hitting 3 levels deep and indenting each
time for each threaded message just going one level deep for all with lines drawn. 

Also is the DELETE key going to be "smart"?  If one is NOT viewing in threaded mode and sorts based
on FROM....will it skip to Joe's #1 message, Joe's #2, Joe's #3 or will it skip to the next unread
message based upon when received.  It'd be cool if the user sorts...threaded or whatever instead of
having to use the down arrow key to navigate and then hitting the Delete Key to advance to the next
message within the list (whichever way sorted) that the Delete key will SAY ...."hit down arrow key
within the list view and delete the message."  

Currently I believe hitting the delete key skips to the next unread message based upon when received
or perhaps I'm totally off based.

It seems that as most apps evolve they squeeze more features in limited space and thus shrinkify
icons...basically do more with less screen space. To me it gives it more of a polished look. For
example on Red Hat 6.2 python anaconda that snake's icons are HUGE.  I wish they would shrink them a
tad and decrease the line space between the fields so one wouldn't have to scroll so much, etc.

How about saving some screen space in Evolution.  I seem to always hide the shortcut bar...either
squeeze it thin perhaps like a slim jim...or how about super-dinky icons (or no icons) along with
text [Inbox, Calendar, Contacts] on the dark grey status bar which current shows which folder you
are in.

And then how about changing the 'display current folder' location to the same light grey bar as
SEARCH is on the far left next to the big X.

Speaking of actions-expunge, it takes evolution 43 seconds to expunge
one message from my mbox, which contains about 4000 messages. Also, Get
mail took 38 seconds to get one message from a server on the same LAN.
Is this a fundamental problem with storing all email messages in a
single file, or can it be worked around? If not, how about storing each
email in a separate file?

If you're using IMAP, it doesn't support expunge in 0.2, to protect
your mail from Evolution bugs.

Those mean different things... in the first, you have a message, and a
reply to it, and a reply to the reply. In the second, you have a
message and two replies to that message.

This is important for when a particular thread of a conversation turns
useless. You can then skip all further messages in that thread and
pick up again at the next message that is outdented far enough.

> Also is the DELETE key going to be "smart"?

Yes, it's a bug that Delete and N and P don't follow the visual order
right now.

Yeah, so does everyone else, AFAIK.

The former is. To expunge a message, it needs to copy the entire mbox
to a temp file without the expunged message, and then move it back. So
this will be slow.

Getting mail being slow is probably a bug.

> If not, how about storing each email in a separate file?

Yes, there will probably be MH and/or maildir providers eventually.

The UW IMAP also doesn't seem to support delete on mh
folders.

(But I'd be delighted to be proved wrong, or to learn
of versions that do.)

Seems to be a missing feature.  I can delete all I want in a Vfolder and
it 
wont work, but if I delete in the Vfolder, go to the Inbox and expunge
all is fine.

Reading Radagasts article on advogato made me think of an interface idea
that I've had for some time now that would likely be handy for the majority
of GUI apps.

Many Unix users desire the efficiency of the CLI, whereas a GUI often has a
much shallower learning curve.  Thus I propose the following...

A widget that is the equivalent to the command line, where one enters
commands in it just as any other command line interface.  It could be
invoked by a key combination and just hover at the bottom of the screen, and
probably only be one or two lines tall (just as the input box for IRC
clients...).  It would lose focus or disappear by another key combination
(for those tasks with which the GUI is more efficient...).   It would likely
not be out by default, but if it were a consistent command to invoke it, it
would likely be adopted by many projects, and used by many powerusers.

What do you think?

This is a useful gadget.  Emacs provides two variants of this -- M-x
for "simple" commands (where you just need to specify the command to
invoke), and M-: for more complex commands, where you can enter any
elisp expression and emacs will evaluate it.

(vi also provides the same thing, but I'm an Emacs user, so I'll stay
with what I know.)

The second (more general) form of course requires fairly powerful
scripting support in the application.  This is more work, but it pays
off very quickly for power users.

One thing I like about the way that emacs provides this functionality
is that it can be invoked by a keypress regardless of what is
currently in your main buffer.  So it's context-insensitive, even if
some of the commands you can invoke through it do depend on context.
This is critical to making it useful to those power users -- if I had
to click on a text box to invoke the commands, I'd probably leave
emacs for vi :)

Can you create a terminal version?  Seriously, I would like 
scripting capabilities external to Evolution, no matter what 
language it's in.  This way, things can be done unattended by power 
users.  Perhaps Evolution and the terminal tool, say "evoctl", could 
communicate via a pipe or IPC..  Or, say when Evolution is not 
running, evoctl could be a front end to capabilities in Camel.

Caveat:  I am new to Evolution, and some of my ideas might not be 
self-consistent or feasible.

Oaf has stupidly been setup to make with -Werror in its

Multiple mailboxes arne' timplemented yet.  So the fix is to wait
till they are (should b e soon i believe).

Subject: [Evolution] Interoperability API / Protocol ? Which way ?

Hi,

i'm working in a firm which developped an online Agenda (+AddressBook)
I'm not here to make an advert for it but to ask a few questions :

We're developping 'synchronisers' (aka small plug-ins to make your
offline and your online agenda in Sync). For the Windows platform, we're
Ok :

we've just finished with the one for Outlook (97 & 2000), Outlook
Express & Palm are on the Way. But as i use Linux to develop this agenda
(the online one), i'd like to sync it with whatever Organizer/Agenda
lives on Linux.

	As Evolution would replace (for me) GnomePIM and Balsa, i'd like to
sync it with my Linux offline agenda.

So my question is : how should i attack Evolution internals ?

For Outlook, that was OLE_Automation/COM, for OE it was MAPI, for Palm
it's a conduit, for Exchange it's CDO ...

Should i use CORBA ? Should i make adds to Evolution source ? Would
there be a plug-in system (one for Palm, one for whatever online agenda
you want ...) ? Should i use iCalendar ?

Anyway, you're making good work. That's really close to Outlook
(graphically). Would it be accessible via a scripting language ? (did i
say gb ??)

Bye and thanks for any response

Thanks for the tip. it now (seems to) installs no problem.
BUT now I am stuck on the ./configure step with evolution.
When running ./configure I get the following error message:

checking for pilot-link version >= 0.9.3... configure: error: pilot-link
0.9.3 required

I do not need this, can it be switched off??
It is installed via rpm from Helix-Gnome and I have also downloaded the
tarball and installed but get the same error when going back to ./configure
with evolution.
Any ideas would be appreciated......nearly there.....
dave.

Subject: [Evolution] Cant run evo

Just downloaded the evolution 0.2 files (all rpms, but compiled the evolution
code from source), but when I run evolution, I get:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443751
d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

So, how can I "set OAF_INFO_PATH" to get it running ?

Cheers,
paul

almost there, I hope!!!
OK, now I have all required packages installed and evolution seems to
compile and install without any errors.
But when I try to run Evolution it crashes with a segment fault immediately,
error message below:

You basically have to talk to the wombat (the Evolution server that
handles the calendar and the addressbook) for doing syncing.

The documentation is unfinished, but it will be worked on. In the
meantime, I can tell you we have people working on Palm Pilot
synchronization already (the code should be ready for consumption
relatively soon), and that their work will probably be a good example of
how to get things to work.

The "Maybe..." bit is assuming that the shell couldn't launch
evolution-mail. But you will also get that error if evolution-mail
crashed immediately after launching. If so, there should be some other
interesting error message printed somewhere before that one...

Hi !

When I send html mails with Evolution, I'd like to have my own defaults
(background/text/link colors). I tried to emulate this by saving an empty page with the
right settings in the editor, but when I reload it, the link color is replaced
by the text color. It's a bug ! :o)

If you 're using bash do:

if OAF is installed on /usr/local
then run evolution.

I am not sure if this is relevant.  You feedback is appreciated.
The quoted article mentions Java APIs that might be useful for
integrating Evolution within enterprise IT systems.

Subject: [Evolution] IMAP nits.

This is looking good. A few nits, though:

I tested IMAP with the U Washington server on my local system.
To make my unix folders in ~/Mail show up as IMAP folders, I had to
enter "//home/jk/Mail" as path. The extra / can't be right.

I had to stop and start Evolution for the configuration to "take".

The IMAP INBOX no longer showed up when I set the path. I guess the
path is intended to be the personal namespace as specified in RFC
2342. If so, this is a bug. RFC 2342 specifies that INBOX must appear
within the personal namespace.

I tried to add another mail source with no path to get at INBOX. But
then the original mail source had disappered next time I started
evolution.

With no path, evolution asks the server to list all files on my
account. There's a lot of them, so there should be a limit. (I guess
you are planning to add the "only list subscribed" option at some
point, but a limit would be useful anyway, or at least a way to tell
it to stop.)

Tha mail source type is called IMAPv4. In fact, from reading the code
it looks like Evolution only supports IMAPv4rev1. IMAPv4 is an
obsolete variant which nobody uses - except my wife! I guess I can
come up with some code for plain IMAPv4 if there is any interest - I
have contributed IMAPv4 support to mutt in the past.

The ability to have a cron job import mail in to the beast rather than
turn up after a weekend and wait 5 mins while it imports N hundred
emails would be the first thing I would setup...  I hate loading
netscape, and having it hog the processor for a minute while it imports
a few hundred mails.  It's simply ugly, and ugly is often bad.

Also, one could have said script running every 5 mins, and as well as
importing, notify of important email without having to start evolution. 
Kind of like the reminders from outlook at the moment, though way more
usefull. Who wants to be reminded of an apointment when you could have a
message pop up telling you some jokes have arrived!

Anybody's open to create a terminal version, fortunately
we've done most of the hard work :)

As for background importing, well maybe at some
point, but not just yet.  Its certainly possible, but
I would suggest it can wait till post 1.0.

Subject: [Evolution] User defined lists and text fields

Something that would be really cool to have, would be user defined pull down
lists.

Thus, say I'm in the construction industry, and I deal with five primary
types of professionals.  Then I would like to define a new pull down list as
Profession - and add the elements of {Architect, Mechanical Engineer, Mason,
Electrical Engineer}.  Also, if in the future I start dealing with other
professions, I would like to append {Plumber, Landscaper, etc.}

This would make Evolution vastly more flexible than any of the other contact
managers out there, and would make it quickly customizable by profession.
(Much more so than just user defined fields, something which some contact
managers already have...).

It would also be cool to have user defined free text fields.  (Not just a
notes field necessarily.  There are category specific notes that I would
like to define in order to reduce the search area/time, as well as ease
report making, and exporting...)

Thus it would be relatively trivial to for any user to imitate any of the
current Contact Managers and to add any customization that would be valuable
for them.  This is something that will knock all of the other contact
managers out of the park...  (Incidentally, I've been doing a review of
contact managers and 'Business Intelligence', Customer Relations Management
(CRM), and Technical Support software (most of which are just glorified
contact managers...) software for my company.  They generally are inflexible
and have horrid UIs, but they all have a few features that are invaluable to
an industry niche, and thus capture a small corner of the market.  With
these additional features, we should be able to be 'all things to all
people' in  extremely short order and without any need for advanced skills.

Thanks for listening,

Subject: [Evolution] Evolution Compilation error

--0-846930886-964533725=:16894
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


 
I've been trying to compile the Evolution package, I've compiled all the dependant packages and they compiled properly. When I tried to compile Evolution, it requested GConf and gconf-config. I then installed GConf and it compiled properly. I retried to compile Evolution and it kept telling me that it couldn't find GConf 0.5 (which is the version that I compiled). I used the PREFIX option on ./configure where prefix=/usr. GConf is actually in /usr/bin and Evolution shoud have picked it there.


Am I missing something here ? I'm running on Helix Gnome. Besides that missing piece, I'm almost ready to test Evolution. An answer would be deeply appreciated.

Thank you

Make sure you have removed the 'config.cache' file in te top of
the build tree, it sounds like it didn't find it, then
is now caching it and isn't seeing the installation (from the
steps you've outlined at least).

You don't need to specify the full path, you can setup your source as:
source=imap://user@host/Mail

that will work, and remember: the first '/' is a separator and NOT treated
as part of the namespace, that's why you found you needed "//"

Oh, hmmm - you probably did this through the editor - ok, the editor is
"broken" as it does need the first char to be a /, I'll have to see if I
can't get it so that is automagically assumed

I don't see why it souldn't show the INBOX... always works for me

This is because Evolution can't handle more than 1 server right now (this
will change in the near future)

Yes, currently it's just using a LIST instead of an LSUB command, until we
have a way to subscribe in the UI, I will probably leave it as LIST

Yes, I'm basing this on IMAPv4rev1
I could probably add support for v4 also

I was wondering if you could give me more info on widget/applet on that is used
with the 'folder bar'. I think the corresponding C code would be e-folder,
right? Is it dependant on Evolution? Will it be usable in other applications besides
Evolution?

OK,
I have got rid of the error message:

OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443
751d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

by deleting my evolution directory in my home folder and typing:

export OAF_INFO_PATH=/usr/local/share/oaf

in a shell prompt.

But now when I try to run evolution I do not get a crash, it recreates the
evolution folder in my home doirectory, but nothing else happens!!!

any solutions, please????

Dave.

It could be a permission problem. 
I had two hosts: one with a working Evolution, on the other only root
could use it (it crashed with the same message as yours).
I got it working by changing owners and modes ;-)

So my current configuration is as follows:

oaf installed in /usr/share/oaf and /usr/bin/oaf*
evolution on /usr/bin/evo*

/usr/bin/oaf* 	--> 555 bin bin
/usr/share/oaf 	--> 755 root root
/usr/share/oaf/* 	--> 444 bin bin
/usr/bin/evo*	--> 755 root root

Hope it helps.

Subject: [Evolution] Viewing previously requested features in bugzilla

Is there some way to look at all of the feature requests on
bugzilla.helixcode.com?

I'd like to enter the requests I've previously made on list, but I don't
want to duplicate them if they've already been entered.

Subject: [Evolution] Exchange.

I have an exchange server I installed at a client's site.  I set up all the
workstations running Outlook 2000.  Evolution looks a lot like Outlook 2000.
I was wondering what type of support if any will be developed to support
Exchange. You guys are doing a great job so far.  I'll definatly be using
evolution as my Mail and Contacts manager at the office.

If somebody will post something and call it an "official" answer, I think
it's time to start making a FAQ.  There seem to be a lot of people asking
the same questions over and over here, and I'm sure everybody is as tired of
it as I am.  :-)  I can put it together, or maybe Aaron wants to do that,
either way, it should get linked from the Evolution homepage.  Thoughts?

Ah, but that assumes people will read it.

From http://www.helixcode.com/apps/evolution-faq.php3, which has been
there for two months or so, linked prominently from the main Evolution
page:

  My company uses Microsoft Exchange (or Lotus Notes). Will I be able to
  replace my Windows machine with a Linux machine running
  Evolution? 
	We will support as many (useful) open protocols as we can, but
	the first release will most likely not be able to interoperate
	with all of the features of various closed proprietary systems.

X-Mailer: Evolution 0.3 (Developer Preview)
From: Ettore Perazzoli <ettore@helixcode.com>
Date: 27 Jul 2000 19:19:33 -0100
Mime-Version: 1.0
Subject: [Evolution] Evolution 0.3 "Jellyfish" is released

Hello,

the crazy monkeys have done it again: a new development snapshot
release of the Evolution groupware suite (0.3, code name "Jellyfish")
is out.

Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, and addressbook application.
This is mostly a bugfix release.

* Availability

        You can get the Evolution 0.3 tarball here:

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/evolution

        Evolution also requires the latest versions of GtkHTML (0.5),
        Bonobo (0.16), OAF (0.4), GNOME VFS (0.2), GConf (0.5),
        libunicode (0.4), GNOME Print (0.20) and ORBit (0.5.3).

        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gtkhtml
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/bonobo
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/oaf
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gnome-vfs
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/GConf
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/libunicode
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnome-print
        ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/ORBit

* Changes since version 0.2

        Shell:

          - Pop-up folder selection.  (Ettore)

          - Added support for multiple views.  (Ettore)

          - Added support for saving component-specific settings, and
            some initial code to save the view's configuration.
            (Ettore)

          - Fixed the Bonobo menu code so that it works with all the
            locales.  (Ettore)

        Mailer:

          - Lots of IMAP fixes.  (Jeff) 

          - You can use an external setuid/setgid movemail program
            (although we don't ship our own yet). If you have one
            installed with emacs, the configure script will find
            that. Otherwise, you can specify --with-movemail=/path.
            (Dan)

          - You can toggle HTML/plain text for an individual message
            in the composer now.  (Ettore)

          - Bonobo embedding sort of works again, but there are
            problems with size allocation somewhere. Attachments can 
            now also be handled by external applications.  (Dan)

          - text/plain mail is now line-wrapped in the mail display,
            to deal with people who don't put newlines in their mail.
            (Dan)

          - Allow user to specify IMAP namespace in the mail config
            dialog.  (Dan, Jeff)

          - Quoted-printable encoder fixes.  (Michael Zucchi)

          - Various NNTP fixes, include a news pane in the config
            dialog.  (Chris Toshok)

          - Some memory corruption fixes.  (Peter Williams)

          - Fix for message not being re-drawn as deleted.  (Peter
            Williams, Jeff)

          - Moving a message to another folder copies the flags now
            (Jeff)

          - Close signature in HTML mail with </PRE>, not <PRE>, and
            default to ~/.signature.  (Michael Meeks)

          - Fixed some confusing behavior in the message threading
            algorithm.  (Dan)

	  - Improvements to the item selection code.  (Chris Lahey)

        Calendar:

          - Added support for a bunch of iCalendar properties.
            (Federico)

          - Conduit for synchronizing the calendar with gnome-pilot
            (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Seth)

          - ETable-based to-do list view ("taskpad"), for your viewing
            pleasure.  (Damon)

        Addressbook:

          - Conduit for synchronizing the addressbook with gnome-pilot
            (requires gnome-pilot from CVS).  (Chris Toshok)

          - Fixed some random crashes.  (Chris Lahey)

          - Implemented a vCard Bonobo control so that we can support
            inline vCard viewing in the mailer.  (Chris Lahey)

          - Quick search looks at both the name and the company
            name now.  (Chris Lahey)

          - Added more functionality to the contact editor's toolbar.
            (Chris Lahey)

          - Support for printing single cards.  (Chris Lahey)

* Mailing lists

        You can subscribe to the Evolution developers list or the
        Evolution users list by going to the Evolution home page on
        http://www.helixcode.com/apps/evolution.php3

Please note that this is still software in development and should not
be used for production work.  We appreciate testers and contributors,
but please remember that Evolution will still be buggy, incomplete,
and temperamental.

Thanks to the many people who have sent in suggestions and fixes.

(And of course, this announcement was sent with Evolution. :-))

Enjoy,
  The Evolution team.

Subject: [Evolution] evolution 0.3 mbox config bug

Yay. Our first 0.3 bug: If you configure an mbox mail source in either
the config druid or the config dialog box, you need to start the path
with two slashes rather than one. (Eg, "//var/spool/mail/danw", which
will result in a URL of mbox:///var/spool/mail/danw.)

Subject: [Evolution] Printing

In both 0.2 and 0.3 I have problems printing mail messages. 

In both cases the print preview and the printed page have a solid black
band across the top of the page. this extends from one side to the
other, and is about 2 1/2 inches tall.
Printing from the calendar and the address book would appear to work
without any problems.

Guy steven.

I think I've just fixed this in CVS, from the testing I've done it seems to
work fine but I could be missing something :-)

Gee, here's another reason to drop the ridiculous policy of mangling
the subject to include the list name:

Sigh, "mbox" instead of "mailbox"?

Unless there's some good reason to do otherwise, and I sincerely doubt
that there is, you should do mailbox URLs compatibly with Netscape 3.

The mailbox: URL is a way of referring to local mail folders, and to
messages within them.  

In 2.0 and 3.0:

  mailbox:pathname		refers to the folder itself.
  mailbox:pathname?id=xxx	refers to a message by ID.
  mailbox:pathname?number=n	refers to a message by number (the
				first message in the folder is 0,
				the second message is 1, etc.)
  mailbox:pathname?id=xxx&number=n    is the same as the "number=n"
				form if and only if message N has the
				ID xxx; else it is the same as the
				"id=xxx" form.  (This is for
				distinguishing between two messages
				with the same id.)

4.0 broke this, making both the "id" and "number" parameters manditory;
changing the "number" parameter from a *message number* to *byte
offset*; and making it impossible to refer to arbitrary files as
mailboxes (you can only refer to files that are under your mail
directory, because of their pathetic database usage.)

To those URLs, you can append some other parameters that override
the various display options on the View menu:

  &headers=all			show all headers
  &headers=some			show interesting headers
  &headers=micro		show the one-line header display

  &part=n.m			display a specific sub-part of a MIME
				message.  The numbers indicate the
				index in the tree.

  &rot13=true			rotate the characters in the text parts

  &inline=true			try and display attachments inline
  &inline=false			don't display attachments inline

Note that the mailbox: url doesn't talk about attachments at all.
It *only* lets you index messages in mbox folders.

Modulo the way 4.x screwed things up, mailbox: was identical to the
file: URL, with the exception that A: it was presented differently,
and B: you could use ?id= and/or ?number= to reference messages in
the (mbox) file by message-id or positional index (or both, with
error-checking.)

I lied a little bit above: all the attachment stuff (part=1.2.3 and so
on) is actually a part of libmime -- those parameters are parsed by *the
thing that displays messages*, not by *the thing that extracts messages
from folders*.  That's why ?part= works with news: urls too -- that's
not built into the URL handler for news: (or mailbox:) but into the
content-type handler for message/*.

Likewise, if you have a HTTP server (or a local file extension) that
returns documents of type message/rfc822, those will be displayed by
libmime, and URLs like http://foo/bar.msg?part=1.2&inline=false will
just magically work.

Note that the traditional syntax would be "mailbox:/a/b/c" 
(or "mbox:/a/b/c") as in "file:/a/b/c".  Saying "mailbox://a/b/c"
would imply that "a" is a hostname, not a path component.

Netscape interprets "file://localhost/a/b/c" the same as
"file:/a/b/c" and interprets "file://foo/a/b/c" the same as
"ftp://foo/a/b/c".

If you go to 'query bug reports', and just select
the default (or maybe add 'fixed' bugs), it will
give you alist of all of the outstanding ones.

Subject: [Evolution] crash when adding new contact

[I'm not sure if I should be submitting this bug report using a tool....]

I just downloaded the 0.3 Evolution Debian packages. The Help->About Evolution
menu confirms that it is version 0.3. I'm running it on a Debian Woody system.

anyway, I start Evolution, click on the Contacts icon, click on the Full Name
button, type in my first and last name, then click OK.

Then I see the red circle with a yellow bar in it. The debug message reads:

'Application "evolution-addressbook" (process 2706) has crashed due to a fatal
error. (Segmentation fault)

This is with a "clean" Evolution system. I haven't added any address book or
calendar entries yet.

[I can't really submit a bug report from that dialog since mail isn't
configured]

thanks for the great work! I'm hoping to start using Evolution regularly just as
soon as it stabilizes a bit more.

cheers,
david

Exactly. The problem is that a bug was introduced into the config
dialog at the last minute that resulted in the path having an extra /
prefixed, so you type /a/b/c and it mistakenly ends up generating
mbox://a/b/c, which the URL code misinterprets. Adding the extra slash
in gets you mbox:///a/b/c, which as you mentioned is equivalent to
mbox://localhost/a/b/c, aka mbox:/a/b/c.

As for "mbox" rather than "mailbox", that's just how Bertrand wrote it
long ago. I hadn't actually realized Netscape used URLs to refer to
mailboxes. There's no reason we couldn't change it, although it may
end up becoming "file:" instead and having something that
distinguishes between mbox, maildir, and MH style folders.

Please note that this is still software in development and should not
be used for production work.  We appreciate testers and contributors,
but please remember that Evolution will still be buggy, incomplete,
and temperamental.

(And of course, this announcement was sent with Evolution. :-))

Enjoy,
  The Evolution team.

How about changing the subscription to send the FAQ to every one who
Subscribes when they Subscribe, have a local Shaman curse it so that all
who fail to read it fail to gain posting rights to the list and a forced

Subject: [Evolution] FAQs and requests on the slashdot article

OK, I just scoured the /. posting about evolution 0.3.0,

and here are the FAQs not answered in the FAQ

1) How can I/will evolution allow me to, see headers?
2) How do I automatically install with debian/redhat/favorite distro?
3) Can I easily migrate my mailbox to/from client Mutt/Pine/etc.?
4) What is the install order for installing Gnome, Gnome Libs, and Evolution
by hand? (i.e. no helix update, debs, rpms, but all from source...)
5) Will I be able to access my mail via Xserver, a terminal etc.
6) What standard mail protocols are supported? (We only mention future
planned support, not what is supported - ie most of MAPI and POP3 ...)
7) What is Evolution?  (Answered in many other places, but not in the FAQ)
8) Where can I download it from? (Again answered in locations aside from the
FAQ)
9) Where can I find documents on how to hack it?

Okay, that's it for the FAQs

Now for frequent feature requests -
1) Interact with the proprietary servers (MS Exchange, Lotus Exchange...
etc.)
2) seemless/easy GnuPG, PGP support (which we got a patch for yesterday -
yay)
3) Remote access via terminal/xserver

Hope you all find this useful

 You forgot rpm -tb the rest of the tar.gz. In other
words, you need hours on my lowly machine to get that
up and running. Heck, it's way to much longer than a
fast download :)

Subject: [Evolution] v0.3.1 doesn't like my birthday (Date problem with contacts when saving
 changes via Icon)

Hello,

each time you save a contact via the save_icon, both birthday &
anniversary date
are 'decremented' by one day.

First, my birthday was 5/19/1977, i changed something else (Office
Field) and saved.
Reopening it, i saw 5/18/1977. Retrying it -> 5/17/1977.

Same thing with Anniversary field

Quite strange.

Accessory, the tooltip behind the save_icon is 'save the appointment and
close ...'


Bye

I've seen this before.  My guess is they are using the unix time stamp,
and are setting hours, mins, & seconds to 0, and the day doesn't actually
start till the 1st second.  There for it ends up subtracting 1 day when
you write the data.  At least that's what the problem was with my code
that did that same thing.

I just tried reproducing this and havent' been able to.  What OS and

That's what it does.  That's probably the most common thing someone will
want to do.

Hey there :) I'm new to the list, and at 0.3.1, I figured I'd be able to offer some constructive critisism. However, I can't seem to run Evolution. Here's the error:

Now, I installed everything in a very sane manner, and both tarballs(oh boy - that was a long compile) and RPMs give me the same error.

This is a strange problem (bug?). It shouldn't be trying to load the 0.2
version of the vee module so I'm not sure what gives. What you could try
doing is a making a link from 0.2/libcamelvee.so.0 to
0.3/libcamelvee.so.0

Subject: [Evolution] configure does not find libxml?

Hi,

I am trying to build evolution-0.3.1, and the configure script seems 
to find all the important libraries until it gets to some xml check. 
There I get the error:

checking for xmlNewDoc in -lxml... no
configure: error: Could not link sample program

I know I have both libxml-1.8.9-1 and libxml-devel-1.8.9-1 installed. 
I even tried downloading, building, and installing libxml-1.8.7, but 
no luck there.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Ujwal

I sort my email by date, descending.

Doesn't maintain the sorting by date descending (arrow pointing up in
the date column.

And to my wishlist, I'd really love some text wrapping in the compose

In my experience text wrapping works when composing a new message, but
not when 
replying to a message. In the latter case the cursor gets to the end of
the line
and then when you keep typeing the cursor continues to go right, but no
text 
appears on the screen. If you then use the back arrow to get to the
point where 
words stopped appearing and press return, everything appears as typed on
the next 
line.

The configuration bit will now store multiple identities and sources,

Yes.  When auto* tests for a function in a library, it builds a small
test program (which it links) to do this.  If the CFLAGS or LDFLAGS env
var have been set during th auto* script, they are involved in this. 
Probably another library is causing the problem.  Check config.log to
see if you can figure out what library is not being linked properly.

Subject: [Evolution] SMTP Problems

Hi,

Since evolution 0.2, I am getting this error message (dialog box) while trying to send mail via SMTP:

Could not send message:
HELO reponse error: Success: non-fatal

I did not have this problem with evolution 0.1. Unfortunately no information is printed to the console regarding this error. 

Hope someone can help.

Regards,
Stuart MacLean

I picked up the tar balls from the evolution announcement site and oaf doesn't compile.

It uses -Werror but uses pointer arithmetic in a number of files. I had to remove the -Werror to get it

 to compile. It also uses -Wpointer-arith.

I'm using gcc 2.95.2

I looked in the config.log file, and it said that it could not find 
the asound library (-lasound). I searched the web and found that 
libasound is provided by the alsa-lib package. However, when I 
installed that, I still got the same error. alsa-lib provides 
libasound.so and installs it in /usr/lib. Should I be installing some 
other package?

Thanks,

I've also had problems compiling bonobo 0.16, but my problem concerns the gdk-pixbuf. Here is the error I got trying to configure bonobo:

checking for GDK_PIXBUF - version >= 0.6.0... no
*** The gdk-pixbuf-config script installed by GDK_PIXBUF could not be found
*** If GDK_PIXBUF was installed in PREFIX, make sure PREFIX/bin is in
*** your path, or set the GDK_PIXBUF_CONFIG environment variable to the
*** full path to gdk-pixbuf-config.
configure: error: Need gdk-pixbuf!

This is strange because my version of gdk-pixbuf is 0.8 (helix), and I couldn't figure out how to fix this.

Try running evolution-mail in a separate xterm

first make sure to killev, after that run evolution-mail and wait a few
seconds and then start evolution in another xterm, this should allow
evolution-mail to print debug info to the console

Ok, 

I ran evolution-mail in another xterm before starting evolution and here is the output:

 evolution-mail: Yeeh! We have an owner!
 Decoding addresses -- smaclean@ns.sympatico.ca
 Decoding addresses --
 Decoding addresses --
 sending : EHLO 192.168.0.2
 received: 501 Invalid domain syntax

 camel-smtp-transport::connect(): provider does not use AUTH

At this point, I get the error dialog box stating:

 Could not send message:
 HELO response error: Success: non-fatal.

When I telnet to the smtp provider, here is what I get:

 220 jubilee.ns.sympatico.ca ESMTP server (Post.Office v3.5.2 release 221 ID# 0-66967U86000L86000S0V35 ready Sat, 29 Jul 2000 19:10:44 -0300

Typing EHLO 192.168.0.2 (I am behind a masqueraded box) in the telnet session produces the same "Invalid domain syntax" error.
Again, sending mail via SMTP in evolution 0.1 worked fine with this provider. 

Hope this helps.

Looks like the ESMTP provider doesn't like your IP/hostname :-)

It should still send your email though, that's why it says "non-fatal"

I'm not sure how to fix the problem other than just making it so the 
dialog doesn't pop up

If you're using Linux, then probably not, vi is a Unix command.

Right now only the gtkhtml editor is working, but in the future
other editors will be supported.

Hmm, unfortunately it does not send the email. No other email clients have

> Will I be able to use vi to compose messages if I use evolution?

We have no-one working on this at present, but it's relatively easy to
do.

The message composer just loads a Bonobo Control which is then embedded
as the editor; you can replace the default editor with a different one
as long as the replacement editor is a Bonobo Control. So one could
write a ZVT-based Bonobo Control that can embed an arbitrary
terminal-based editor, and then Evolution could use any arbitrary
terminal-based editor.

The integration would not be perfect GUI-wise, of course, but if people
really want to use VI for composing email, I guess that's the only way.

Volunteers? :-)

Or the GTK+ version of VIM's "gvim" could be bonobo-ized. I think this
would make a great control.

I'd be into it too BTW. Dunno if I'd have the time to do it myself, but
I'd certainly use it ;)

Just tried out evolution some, it looks great, very smooth :) I would choose it in a instant I knew how to get it to convert my current GnomeCard and GnomeCal files. This would also make it easy to sync with my palm pilot. Or, I guess finishing the pilot interfaces would work also. Any info on either items??

Hm. Yes, that's wrong. It should be "EHLO [192.162.0.2]". That should
be fixed. I guess your SMTP server is just pickier than most.

I like what exmh does: edit in vi, prompt for send/re-edit/re-edit in
mime-aware editor/various other options.  When you have a message with mime
in it, you first write the plain test part in vi, then quit vi and bring up
the other editor, which mimeifies it and lets you add attachments.  Best of
both worlds.

Do you have gdk-pixbuf-devel installed? If you can't type in
'gdk-pixbuf-config --help' at the prompt and get output, something
is messed up with your installation of gdk-pixbuf-devel --
try 'rpm -V gdk-pixbuf-devel'.

Subject: [Evolution] mail compose blank screen???

Hi All,
After unsuccessfully trying to launch Evolution preview 2, results below:

evolution-shell-WARNING **: Could not activate component
OAFIID:evolution-shell-component:evolution-mail:d3cb3ed6-a654-4337-8aa0-f443
751d6d1b. (Maybe you need to set OAF_INFO_PATH?)

I have now downloaded Evolution preview 3 & the updated bits and pieces, all
install fine except evolution 3 will not ./configure for me!!, not on front
of the machine so don't know the error message now...

BUT, Evolution2 now launches!!!, it will retrieve my pop3 email, but when I
choose to reply or create a new message I am left with a grey screen, all
buttons disappear and I am left with no options except for quitting....

Any help on how to workaround this would be appreciated,
thanks, Dave.

I believe bonobo .16 is the latest version of it....they might have made a
mistake and meant .05 because on the helixcode site it says that evolution
.15 is required to compile. Just grab the latest one which is .16 and you'll
be fine

Well, generally yes .5 is > .15, but this is versioning, thus the . is just
a separator, not a decimal, so you should think of it a 15 and 5

This may be a silly question, but can I build Evolution w/o support for

Since I don't have a PalmPilot, I installed Gnome w/o pilot-link, or
gnome-pilot.  When
I try to build, I get an error that libpisock cannot be found.  I went

pilot-link and gnome-pilot, but evidently I need the latest versions
from CVS.  Since I

Are there any special tricks to building without pilot support?  Maybe a

Hi there,

I have Evolution 2 running fine, from a RPM.
I wanted to look at E 3.0 but when I try to
compile it I get the following error.

checking whether to enable maintainer-specific
portions of Makefiles... no
checking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu
checking for gnome-config... no
checking for gnomeConf.sh file in
/usr/local/lib... not found
configure: error: Could not find the gnomeConf.sh
file that is generated by gnome-libs install

any Suggestions.

Thanks.
Jason.

I had the same problem. You have to compile gtkhtml-package against
bonobo and oaf.

That is, make sure that you have bonobo and oaf packages properly 
configured and installed and then recompile gtkhtml. It's not necessary
to recompile whole Evolution.

When are we going to have some keyboard shortcuts? Using that toolbar is
quite disturbing.

Do you have the gnome-libs-devel package installed?  You need it.
The *-devel packages have *-config, *Conf.sh, header files, etc.

In addition, you will need to configure evolution like this:
./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
otherwise you need to set GNOME_PATH and ACLOCAL_FLAGS, etc.
(or alternatively, you can build gnome-libs from source, and then install
evolution and its dependencies into the same prefix you installed
gnome-libs into).
Read the evolution/README file for more details.

  Hi there,
  I have Evolution 2 running fine, from a RPM. I wanted to look at E 3.0 but
when I try to compile it I get the following error.

  checking whether to enable maintainer-specific portions of Makefiles... no
  checking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu
  checking for gnome-config... no
  checking for gnomeConf.sh file in /usr/local/lib... not found
  configure: error: Could not find the gnomeConf.sh file that is generated
by gnome-libs install



  any Suggestions.

  Thanks.
  Jason.

The configure script should only try to find libpisock if it finds the
gnome-pilot package. You're sure you don't have it installed? What
does the configure output say in the lines before the error? What does
"gnome-config --modversion gpilot" say?

It crashes. This bug has already been fixed in CVS. Until 0.4, just
"don't do that, then" :-}. (Or you can create an empty mbox file in
each dir: "touch ~/evolution/local/Drafts/mbox", etc.)

The GConf libraries should probably be included as well on the Evolution
Additional packages list.  I don't recall if Evolution requires these or
not, but its certainly required by other packages.

Hi.. I am attempting to compile Evolution .3 and have run into a problem in
the configure script...I only have a vague output from it because i am not
at my computer right now but it is at the point after it looks for pisock
and when it looks for xmlNewDoc it tells me

cannot link sample xml program...

is there something i am missing....i have all the required libraries (i
think) for compiling evolution...If anyone has any ideas on how to get
around this and get a solution to this problem please don't hesitate...

I am also having this problem.  I'm not sure that our problems are exactly
related, but here are the last few lines in the config.log file where it
fails:

configure:6558: checking for xmlNewDoc in -lxml
configure:6577: gcc -o conftest -g -O2 -Wall -Wunused  -I/usr/include
-DNEED_GNO
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lasound
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
configure: failed program was:
#line 6566 "configure"
#include "confdefs.h"
/* Override any gcc2 internal prototype to avoid an error.  */
/* We use char because int might match the return type of a gcc2
    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.  */
char xmlNewDoc();

int main() {
xmlNewDoc()
; return 0; }

As you can see it can't find libasound.a or libasound.so (I think)  I have
looked around and don't seem to have them, nor do I know where to get it.
supposedly from RPMfind, the alsaplayer package contains it, but it doesn't
appear to to me... I still have the same problem after I install it anyway...
I can't for the life of me figure out how -lasound is getting into the script,
so I can't even take it out.  Oh well, I hope that helps you.  I know I am
stuck though...

Subject: [Evolution] Quick tool to import a directory of mbox-style files

--XsQoSWH+UP9D9v3l
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I wanted to import my old ~/Mail directory with 15+ years of stored mail
into Evolution (a nice stress-test), so I came up with this quick and
dirty hack to mass-import a directory of mbox-style files and subdirectories
into the specified Evolution folder.  I'm sending it here in case it might
be useful to other Evolution users.

Useage: mbox-import /path/to/evolution/local/foldername.  It reads all
files and subdirectories, and copies them into the specified folder.  It
descends into subdirectories and does the Right Thing (I hope).  Each
mbox file is created as a subfolder of the specified folder, with 
subdirectories created as sub-subfolders.

Caveats: Only been tested with mbox-style folders.  Will copy any file,
regardless of whether it's an mbox folder.  Copies, not moves.  Shouldn't
touch the original files.  Only tested on my machines (RH6.2, Solaris 7).
YMMV. 

ja.

Do you have libxml 1.8.7? Evolution will not work with any other
version.

I had the same problem. It turned out the sample program tries to link
against libasound that I did not have. I had to the alsa-lib and
alsa-lib-devel rpms.

I had libxml 1.8.9 installed.  I reverted back to 1.8.7 (the only way I
found to do this was to get the 1.8.7 rpms and install them with a
--nodeps and a --force flag.)  "rpm -a -q | grep libxml" now claims that
1.8.7 is installed, but I still get the same errors, again failing to
link with the -lasound flag. (see previous messages in thread for more
detail.) So really, I still don't have much of an idea of what is going
on.   :>

Subject: [Evolution] Filters are gone :(

I spent like an hour doing filters for evolution (I was planning
on trying it as my work email client and I need about 20 filters)
the other day.  But I didn't quite get done with the filters and
I wasn't going to use it yet, so I just closed it.  Well today I
open it, go to Filter Druid to finish the filters, and NONE of my
filters are there anymore!  Can I get them back? Do I just have
to reload a config file?  Or do the filters no longer get saved? 
Thanks!

Misty

PS - I'm running the newest pre-release (not CVS) on RedHat 6.2
updated to the 2.2.16 kernel, on a Celeron 500.  Thanks!

Yes, I got evolution to compile and run, but I still hadproblems. Whenever I
hit the reply button, evolution seemed to hang. I had the libxml 1.8.9
package. I removed it and installed 1.8.7 to see if that works better. It
did. The "Reply" button now works. I removed the libxml and libxml-devel
rpms using rpm -e --nodeps, and compiled and installed the 1.8.7 from the
tarball.

Hmm...Strange....Downgrading to run a package...This will be a problem in a
future with other programs...I hope the evolution team gets ontop of this
problem.

i'll try 1.8.7 to be sure myself that it will actually compile.

Subject: [Evolution] Re-receiving email

I have been using evolution 0.3.1 for my email client for the last day,
and I have noticed that when I receive my mail from the server it works
find, then if I hit Get mail again before there is any new mail, the
last message received from the server in the last Get mail is received
again.  This happens until new mail arrives, then starts again with the
last message from the new mail batch.  I am receiving my mail over pop,
if this helps.

The other thing I noticed, is when your composing a message, if your
cursor is on a line and you hit end, you goto the end of your message,
not the the end of the line, I'm not sure how this is suppost to react
but seems a bit strange when the cursor jumps to the end of your
signature and you have to figure out where you are, the same with home
going to row one char one of the email.

I'm not sure that's a good idea because Evolution adds it's own headers
(X-Evolution) to the header when you use it's import feature, copying the
files to the evolution directory may work but there may be problems

Dan, any comments?

None of the current preview releases of Evolution support multiple accounts,
there is some beginnings of support for that in current CVS HEAD, but it's
still a bit buggy.

Hi Dan,

Is this an old requirement? I have libxml 1.8.9 installed and I can
compile CVS as well as the 0.3.1 tarballs. Am I just lucky? :-)

libxml-1.8.9-0_helix_1
libxml-devel-1.8.9-0_helix_1

Thanks!

Hi Jeff,

That's kind of a bummer. Do you know if it's currently even being worked
on?  Cuz I think it would be much easier to try and use Evolution and try
to debug, etc. if I knew that at least the work I was doing had a chance
of being saved.  Whatcha think?

Thanks!
